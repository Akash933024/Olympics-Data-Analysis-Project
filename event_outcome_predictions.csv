There were 30 starters and the early lead was taken by Denmark Kenneth RÃ¸pke, the fourth starter who was timed in 1:05.168. This was not surpassed until the 16th starter, Soviet rider Aleksandr Kirichenko, went off. Kirichenko rode very strongly and would record the best times on both of the first two laps. But his rear tire began to deflate on the last lap. Rather than request a re-start, his coach, Boris Vasilyev, 1960 tandem bronze medalist, elected to let Kirichenko time of 1:04.499 stand, reasoning that he would be too tired to better that. Vinnicombe was the last starter, and when he recorded 1:04.764 to place second, Kirichenko had his gold medal and Vasilyev was vindicated.

Australian Danny Clark was a surprise silver medalist, although he would become a top professional. Between 1974 and 2000, he won no less than 74 six-day events, a number bettered only by Patrick Sercu. Clark versatility was also displayed at the world championships, winning nine titles in three different disciplines, and 12 medals overall.

Denmark Niels Fredborg had been World Champion in 1967 and 1968 and was favored. Because of the fast track and the altitude, the first 17 finishers broke the previous Olympic record. Gianni Sartori (ITA) was the second man on the line and recorded a time of 1:04.65, only to be followed by Fredborg, who equaled the world record of 1:04.61 held by Sartori, but this would get him only second place. There was then a long gap as Fredborg held the lead until the 24th rider started â Pierre Trentin. The gold went to Trentin, bronze medalist in 1964, and the World Champion in 1966. His time of 1:03.91 was a world record. Trentin would also win a bronze medal in the sprint in Ciudad de MÃ©xico, and would team with Daniel Morelon to win the tandem sprint gold.

A few months before the Helsinki Olympics, Mockridge competed at the Grand Prix de Paris sprint title, the world top invitational event, and became the first amateur to win the open title at that event. He did not race in the sprint at Helsinki, choosing to concentrate on the time trial and the tandem. In the kilo, starting 20th, he won easily, with a margin of 1.6 seconds over Italy Marino Morettini, who was the next-to-last to start. Mockridge would return to win a second gold medal in the tandem, accompanied by Lionel Cox. With Mockridge not in the event, Cox would also win a silver in the match sprint. Morettini had been third in the sprint at the 1951 World Championships, would place second in that event in 1952, and became World Champion in 1953.

But the slow asphalt surface on the Herne Hill Velodrome kept the cyclists far slower than those times. Dupont won the event easily in 1:13.5, a full second faster than the silver medalist, Belgium Pierre Nihant. Dupont was only 20 but was the French champion in both the time-trial and the individual pursuit. Shortly after the Olympics he would place second in the individual pursuit World Championships. He then joined the professional peloton, and would win Paris-Tours in 1951 and 1955, the Circuit de lâIndre in 1952 and 1954, and was French national champion on the road in 1954.

There would not be a World Championship race in the kilometer time trial until 1966, but the first one would be won by Trentin. Sercu would turn professional in 1965. Obviously a top sprinter, he won numerous races because of his sprinting abilities, and won the green jersey at the 1974 Tour de France. His titles included two professional sprint World Championships (1967, 1969), and 18 European Championships, including 12 in the omnium, given to the top all-rounder.

When he started he thought he had taken off before the gun and sat up, thinking he would be given a re-start. But the officials ruled his start to be legal, and he was disqualified. GrÃ¼nke started somewhat slowly, his early splits trailing those of Vaarten, but he was much stronger over the last half of the race, and won the gold medal by almost 1.6 seconds. Vaarten held on for the silver medal, with Fredborg completing his medal set in this event, adding bronze to his 1972 gold and 1968 silver.

Van Egmond would return in 1933 to win the World Championships in the match sprint. Gray was ill with the flu the week before this event but was cured by a âmiracle drugâ given to him by his coach, Jim Ev.

Notably, Pavel Kulizhnikov and Denis Yuskov, who had finished 1-2 at the 2016 Worlds, and had both won World Cup races in the running season, were not allowed to compete. This left two main contenders for the title: Kjeld Nuis and HÃ¥vard Holmefjord Lorentzen. Both had already won gold at the Gangneung Oval, in the 1,500 m and 500 m, respectively. Nuis was the reigning World Champion in the event, while Lorentzen led the current World Cup standings ahead of Nuis.
The track record, set by Nuis at the 2017 Worlds, was bettered in the 13th pair by Kim Tae-Yun. Having placed 30th in the event at the 2014 Olympics, and having only occasionally placed into the international top 10, he was a virtual unknown, but his 1:08.22 moved him into an eventual bronze medal position. Lorentzen then managed to push below 1:08, helped by the fastest full lap of the field. In the final pair, Nuis opened up a tiny gap of 0.15 at the 200 m mark, and carried the advantage all the way to the finish line, leaving him with 1:07.95.

A third Dutchman, Kai Verbij, was the 2019 and 2021 World Champion. The fourth, Kjeld Nuis, was defending champion but had failed at the Dutch Olympic Trials and did not qualify.
The race was held under somewhat tougher ice conditions than the previous races, leading to less impressive times. The first to break the 1:09-barrier was Piotr Michalski, who set 1:08.56 in the fourth pair. His time would remain unbeaten for a long time. Outsiders for a medal such as the two-time World Champion and world record holder Pavel Kulizhnikov or up-and-coming 17-year-old talent Jordan Stolz couldnât break the Pole time. Cornelius Kersten was the first to come close, recording 1:08.79, which would be the ninth fastest time of the day and the best British speed skating result in 58 years. Marten Liiv, Ignat Golovatsiuk and Viktor Mushtakov all hit the 1:08, but with six skaters to go, it was still Michalski in the lead.
The 13th pair saw 1,500 m silver medalist Krol against 2018 silver medalist HÃ¥vard Holmefjord Lorentzen. The favored Dutchman started on a conservative speed, trailing Michalski time at the bell, with the Norwegian close pursuit. With the best final lap of the day, Krol raced to 1:07.92, with Lorentzen half a second behind, both beating the leading time. Race 14 had Otterspeer against the local favorite, Ning Zhongyan. Both were still on Krol pace at 600 m but faded in the last lap and fell out of medal contention. That left only the final pair. Reigning world champion Verbij saw Canadian Laurent Dubreuil take off at world record pace. At 600 m, the two-time world bronze medalist was so far ahead that at the final crossing, Verbij had to give way, choosing to stand up and glide out the race rather than hindering the Canadian and risking disqualification.
Dubreuil held sufficient speed to finish in 1:08.32, enough for silver, a great relief after missing the podium in the 500 m. With both his father Robert Dubreuil and his mother Ariane Loignon former Olympic speed skaters, he became the first Olympic speed skating medalist with two Olympian parents.

Kim indeed reached the final, together with his younger team mate Chae. Gagnon crashed out in the semi-finals, European Champion Nicky Gooch (Britain) taking advantage. Canada was still represented in the final, by Derrick Campbell, who led a large part of the race. With three laps left, Gooch made his move and overtook the Canadian on the inside. But there was no room, and the two touched, leaving Campbell in the sideboards. This left room for Kim to make his move, and he easily defended his title, finishing ahead of Gooch and Chae. But the judges ruled that Gooch had obstructed Campbell, and he was disqualified, so that Chae moved up to the silver medal. The bronze medal was though to go to Campbell, who had gotten up and finished the race, until it was found that he had finished one lap too early, and was classified as a non-finisher. This left the bronze for the surprised winner of the B-final, Marc Gagnon.

1085,"1,000 metres, Men",1994 Winter Olympics,45,Speed Skating,18 February 1994,"Olympiahall, Hamar",43 from 17 countries,na,na,"This event turned out to be a battle between two men fighting for their final chance for an Olympic gold medal: American Dan Jansen and Igor Zhelezovsky of Belarus, less known by the general public. Both men had had a great career, but lacked Olympic gold. Zhelezovsky had won six World Sprint Championships, and had won an Olympic bronze medal in 1988, but had failed at the Albertville Games. Jansen, who had hoped to win the Olympic 500 m on his fourth attempt had failed with a near fall just days earlier. His chances in the 1,000 m were considered slimmer, although he had won the 1000 m World Cup race on the same rink in December. Zhelezovsky hadnât won any 1000 m during the season, but had been consistently among the best. Looking at the season best times, favorite for the gold was Canada Kevin Scott, who had lowered the world record to 1:12.54 in December and had won the final 1000 m at the World Sprint Championships. The first 1000 m in that same championship had gone to Olympic 500 m medallist Sergey Klevchenya, who was just above the world record with 1:12.55.
Zhelezovsky and Klevchenya started in the very first pair. Klevchenya went off fastest, but was caught by the Belarussian usual strong final lap. With 1:12.72, Zhelezovsky was not far off the world record, and Klevchenya trailed at 1:12.85. Three pairs later, Dan Jansen started. At 600 m, he was faster than both Zhelezovsky and Klevchenya, but then had a slight mishap in the first curve of the last lap. But Jansen went on to finish strongly, coming home in a world record of 1:12.43. It was immediately clear this would be the winning time, and Jansen could finally celebrate at the Olympics. At the press conference, he was congratulated by phone by US President Bill Clinton, a courtesy not extended to other American winners at these Games. Like Jansen, Zhelezovsky also ended his career, but with an Olympic silver medal, the first one ever for Belarus.
The victory was an emotional one for Jansen and his family but also for all his fans. He had been either the best or second-best sprinter in the world since around 1988, but had known nothing but disappointment at the Olympics, starting with the 1988 Calgary 500, when he stumbled and fell at 100 metres, having to start the race only hours after hearing that his sister, Jane, had died from leukemia. But he had always faced his defeats with grace and magnanimity. The Official Report of the 1994 Olympic Winter Games wrote, âAt the moment there were no Norwegians, Dutch, Americans, or people of other nationalities among the spectators, only fans of Dan Jansen.â When his world record time was announced, his fellow competitors yelled and cheered for him. Jansen skated an emotional victory lap, carrying his 81/2-month-old daughter in his arms. Her name was Jane.

Dan Jansen had won the first 1,000 m at the World Sprint Champions a week before the Games, but after hearing of his sister death shortly before the start of the 500 m, Jansen had fallen in his race, and it was unclear what to expect of him. Jansen team mate Eric Flaim was better known as a miler, but had won the second 1,000 m at West Allis. The winner of the Olympic 500 m, Uwe-Jens Mey had won two World Cup races in the 1,000 during the season and was highly considered. In addition, there were two Soviet skaters, Igor Zhelezovsky and Nikolay Gulyayev. Zhelezovsky was the 1985 and 1986 World Sprint Champion, and held the 1,500 m world record. Gulyayev had been the star of the 1987 season, winning both the European and World Allround Championships. But at the Davos World Cup in January, it was revealed that Norwegian team members had intercepted packages of anabolic steroids. They had been intended for Stein Olav Krosby, who had been regularly receiving packages of the drugs from Gulyayev, usually using a middle man to deliver them to Krosby. While a Soviet team doctor was fired, Gulyayev was not punished by the Soviet skating federation. As Gulyayev had not tested positive himself, and possession of doping was not illegal per Olympic rules, Gulyayev was able to take part in Calgary as planned.
Of these contenders, Gulyayev was the first to skate. As an allround skater, his 200 m split was relatively poor, but his full laps of 27.16 and 28.70 brought him to 1:13.03, half a second behind the official world record (in March 1987, both Nick Thometz and Andrey Bakhvalov had been faster than Pavel Pegov 1:12.58, but their times were not held in an officially announced competition). In the next race, Jansen was, as expected, ahead of Gulyayev splits, before falling once again. Pair five then saw Mey and Zhelezovsky race each other. Mey, the better 500 m racer, was well ahead at the bell, while Zhelezovsky matched Gulyayev splits. But Mey faded in the final lap. While he was able to hold off Zhelezovsky, he was unable to best Gulyayev time, finishing in 1:13.11, against 1:13.19 for his opponent. Flaim, too, was level with Gulyayev at 600 m, but lost half a second in the last lap.

The 1,000 was one of the two distances at the World Sprints, held since 1970, and its popularity in that tournament led to its inclusion on the Olympic Program.  The world record holder was Valery Muratov, who skated 1:16.92 at Medeo in 1975. But the favorite was probably his Soviet teammate, Aleksandr Safranov, whose record Muratov had broken. Safronov had won the 1975 World Sprints and won both 1,000s at that meet, and in 1974 was fourth at the World Sprints, also winning one of the 1,000s. In the opening pair, Canada GaÃ©tan Boucher posted the inaugural Olympic record for the event, finishing in 1:21.23. The second pair saw unheralded American Peter Mueller well under Boucher time, crossing the line in 1:19.32. And that would win the gold medal in a major upset as nobody got close to Mueller time. In the fifth pair, Norway JÃ¸rn Didriksen finished in 1:20.45, over a second behind Mueller, but it would be good for the silver medal. Muratov came up in the eighth pair and was close to Mueller time at 600 metres, but faded on the last lap to 1:20.57, which brought him a bronze medal. Skating in the ninth pair, Safranov would not make the podium, finishing fourth. Mueller would win only other one other major race in his career, a 500 at the 1977 World Sprints. His wife was Leah Poulos-Mueller, who won three speed skating silver medals in 1976 and 1980, although they would later divorce. Mueller later had an extensive coaching career, coaching the US team, and later the Dutch and Norwegian national teams.

Winner of the 500 m, Uwe-Jens Mey, did not even start because of a flu. Those who did start suffered hard in the final lap due to the difficult ice conditions. The most spectacular failure was probably Dan Jansen. After surprisingly missing out on a medal in the 500 m, Jansen attempted a )fly or die) race. Having the fastest times at 200 and 600 m, he recorded one of the slowest final laps to place only 26th. While Jansen had been better known as a 500 m skater, that was not the case for Igor Zhelezovsky. The Belarussian, representing the Unified Team in Albertville,
had dominated the distance for years. Yet he also appeared powerless in the final meters, finishing 6th in the end. Other medal candidates, like Eric Flaim and Toshiyuki Kuroiwa, failed similarly.
But those skaters that did make it to the podium made it a close affair. The first to go below 1:15 was Japan Yukinori Miyabe, the lesser known, and thus far less successful, brother of Yasunori. His 1:14.92 was bettered by Olaf Zinke, an outsider from the German team, who recorded 1:14.85. The last two skaters to approach them skated against each other in pair 9. Kim Yun-Man and Gerard van Velde both finished very close to Zinke and Miyabe. Kim missed Zinke time by 0.01, while Van Velde gap with Miyabe was of the same size. In all, just 0.08 seconds separated first place from fourth.
The Olympic gold medal was by far Zinke greatest success, and it would remain that way. Earlier, he had placed well at some World Cup races, even winning two in Helsinki 1990, and collected titles in both East Germany and the reunited country. Kim, who won South Korea first ever Winter Olympic medal, would go on to win the 1995 World Sprint Championships. Miyabe would be among the best Japanese sprinters for several years, and would capture four World Cup wins over the years.

The 2006 and 2010 champion had won the World Championships in 2011 (and was 3rd in 2012 and 2013), had won the 1,000 m World Cup in 2012 and had claimed the first three World Cup races in the running season. Behind him, there was a sizeable group of medal candidates. Mo Tae-Beom had won the most recent World Cup race, while World Sprint Champion Michel Mulder had shown his form in the 500 m. Dutch racer Kjeld Nuis had done well early in the season but had failed to qualify at the Dutch Trials, but one who defeated him in the Trials was 2012 World Champion Stefan Groothuis. Kazakh skater Denis Kuzin had surprised the field at the World Championships in Sochi a year earlier, and was hoping to repeat that performance.
The 2010 Olympic champion in the 1,500 m, Mark Tuitert, was the first to record a fast time, as his 1:09.29 remained unbeaten until pair 14, when Samuel Schwarz broke the 1:09 barrier. His time seemed good for a medal, but was beaten by compatriot Nico Ihle two pairs later. Ihle pairmate, Groothuis, went much quicker than that however. Groothuis, who had seen depression after winning the 2012 World Sprint Championship, combined a decent opening with two excellent laps to finish in 1:08.39, just narrowly outside the unofficial lowland World Record of 1:08.33 (held by Davis). The time was immediately challenged in the next pair. Canadian Denny Morrison was 0.01 back at the bell, but lost 0.05 seconds in the final lap to just miss Groothuisâ time. Michel Mulder was soundly beaten by Morrison, but his 1:08.74 moved him into third place. All of the remaning six skaters were essentially beaten within 600 m, none of them bettering 1:09. Defending champion Davis ranked 8th, to his disappointment. It would later be rumored that the new aerodynamic suit developed for the American team by Under Armour was counter-effective, although this was never officially confirmed.
While Groothuisâ gold medal may not have been completely expected, Morrison silver medal was even more unlikely. He had failed to qualify for the distance at the Canadian trials due to a fall his first attempt, and failing to make the cut by 0.10 in a re-skate. Teammate Gilmore Junio, however, had seen that Morrison was in better shape and decided to give up his own spot in favor of Morrison. In May 2014 Junio was given a special commemorative medal in Canada for his act of sportsmanship.

He posted the fastest split at 200 metres, at 600 metres, and for each lap, winning his third gold medal by a full 11/2 seconds over Boucher, a ridiculous margin for the 1,000 at this level of competition, posting 1:15.18. Third place was a tie, with Norway Frode RÃ¸nning and the Soviet Vladimir Lobanov both posting 1:16.91, and winning bronze medals.

Since his Torino championship, Davis had continued to dominate this distance. In 2007 and 2008 he had won the world title, and in 2008 and 2009 claimed the 1,000 m World Cup. On 7 March 2009, Davis became the first man to beat 1:07 in the event, lowering the world record considerably to 1:06.42. And Davis had been quite untouchable during the running season as well, winning each of the four World Cup races contested prior to the Games. Davis status of a favourite was even further increased by the fact that the other skaters behind him had not performed consistently, and the podium was essentially open to about 10 skaters.
Shani Davis also enjoyed the advantage of having drawn the last pair, and could watch his opponents prior to taking the ice himself. When he did, the fastest time had been set by Mo Tae-Beom, the surprising winner of the 500 m. The Korean had posted the fastest splits of the race in his duel with Chad Hedrick. As usual, the 2006 5,000 m champion, posted a strong final lap, but Mo held on to win in 1:09.12, two tenths ahead of Hedrick. While not known for his quick openers, Davis trailed Mo early splits by less than three tenths, then pulled away in the final 400 m to win in 1:08.94.

On the second day of competition there, Lee Gyu-Hyeok again lowered it to 1:10.42, before Jeremy Wotherspoon, brought it down even further to 1:10.16. Of these skaters, the top favorite was Jan Bos, having won the distance twice at the recent World Sprint Championships. He was expected be challenged by the other Dutch and Canadian skaters, though.
With no skaters having approached the 1:11.00 barrier yet, the first to touch it was 500 m champion Hiroyasu Shimizu. Not known for his 1000 ms, the Japanese continued his 500 m form and clocked 1:11.00 exactly, a new personal best. The very next pair featured an outside favorite for a medal, Ids Postma. Not a regular 1000 m skater, he was better known as an allround skater. His Olympics had not been as he had expected, having fallen in the first 500 m race, and losing the 1500 m gold due to a mishap in the last curve. Postma got his revenge in this race, setting the fastest time, by virtue of an excellent final lap. Wotherspoon led Postma split at the bell by 0.6 seconds, but dropped back to an eventual 6th place finish. Leeuwangh and Sylvain Bouchard met a similar fate, leaving only Jan Bos to challenge in the final pair. He, too had a half-second lead over his compatriot, but also failed in the final lap, missing the gold by just 0.07 seconds.

As it turned out, the American and Dutch skaters were most ready to fill the gap Wotherspoon left, as they wound up taking places one through seven. The least likely of these seven to win was probably Gerard van Velde. The dominant Dutch sprinter of the 1990s, he had been unlucky in international competition. At the 1992 Olympics, he had placed 4th and 5th at just hundredths from the podium. He was unable to adapt to the clap skates in 1998, and retired. Coming out of retirement, he again reached the world top, but again placed fourth at the 2002 World Sprint Championships and in the Olympic 500 m. Having nothing to lose, he skated an amazing 1,000 m. His final time of 1:07.18 was more than half a second below the world record, and none of the other competitors would come close.

He had taken part in six of nine World Cup races, and won them all (taking the rest off to try and qualify for the US Olympic short track team). In passing, Davis also bettered the world record, which dated from the 2002 Olympics and set it at 1:07.03. The only question mark was his performance at the recent World Sprint Championships, where he had âonlyâ placed 6th and 3rd in the 1000 ms.

In the quarter-finals, Yang appeared in top shape, beating Jeon world record with 1:31.991. The two then raced through the second semi-final together, qualifying easily. Both of them had a teammate in the final as well, with Won Hye-Gyeong qualifying for South Korea, and Yang Yang (S) for China.

The third skater to have won international competitions that season was Franziska Schenk (Germany), winner of 3 World Cup races and bronze medalist at the 1997 Worlds. After her victory in the 1,500 m, Marianne Timmer was also highly considered. She had taken the 1997 World Championships, and was one of the early adopters of the clap skate, but had not yet medaled internationally in the Olympic season.
After 16 pairs, the former World Record and Olympic Record by Rothenburger was still unbeaten. But 500 m champion Catriona Le May Doan again bested the old record, clocking 1:17.37. This was enough to hold off Sabine VÃ¶lker (second at the World Sprints), but not Timmer. She trailed her opponent, Schenk, at the first split, but Schenk fell in the next corner. Timmer then improved on Le May time by 8 tenths, lowering the Olympic Record to 1:16.51. The only remaining contender was Chris Witty, who matched Timmer split times, but not her final lap, to finish in 1:16.51. Timmer victory made her the third woman to double in the 1000 and 1500 m at the same Olympics, after Skoblikova (1964) and Enke (1984).

Enke had won the World Sprints in 1980, 1981, and 1983, and was second in 1982, and at the World Championships, she had won in 1982 and earlier in 1984, placing second in 1981 and 1983. Her biggest challengers were expected to be the defending champion, Soviet Nataliya Petrusyova, who held the world record of 1:19.31, set at Medeo in 1983, and was the 1982 World Sprint champion, and Enke East German teammate, Andrea SchÃ¶ne, who had won the 1983 World Championships and was second to Enke in both 1982 and 1984.
The 500 champion, Christa Rothenburger, started in the first pair and posted an Olympic record 1:23.98. SchÃ¶ne was in the second pair, and although she started slowly, she was well ahead of Rothenburger at 600 metres, and finished in 1:22.83 to take the lead. Enke was in the next pairing. She had the fastest start of the event and held on to it, crossing the line in 1:21.61, which would win her the gold medal. Petrusyova was in the sixth group but her time of 1:23.21 would be good only for bronze. One other medal favorite was Nataliya Glebova, who started very well, but fell at 150 metres.
A few weeks later, at the 1984 World Sprint Championships, Enke would again win the title, this time dominating by winning all four races. In her career she would win eventually win eight Olympic medals (3 gold, 4 silver, 1 bronze), and 11 World Championships (6 sprint, 5 all-around). The three medalists finished in the exact same order as they had done in the women 1,500, four days earlier.

Dutchwoman Jutta Leerdam had won the world title in 2020 (and was second in 2021), and with a fifth place in the 500 m had shown good form. Japan Miho Takagi had already secured three silver medals (500 m, 1,500 m and team pursuit) and was looking to win her first individual Olympic gold medal. An outsider was Brittany Bowe. Although a three-time world champion in the event (2015, 2019, 2021), and leader in the 2021/22 1,000 m World Cup, Bowe performances in the Beijing Olympics had been below expectations.
The first top time of the day was recorded by 1,500 m bronze medalist Antoinette de Jong in pair three, with 1:14.92. This remained unchallenged until Leerdam took the ice against Kimi Goetz in the 11th pair. After a tight crossing with Goetz, Leerdam made a small mishap in the third corner, touching the ice briefly with her hand. Despite this, she recorded the fastest full lap of the field, holding on for a final time of 1:13.83.
Two pairs later, it was Takagi turn. After recording the fastest opening of the day (17.60) together with Golikova, she paced her full lap a bit, trailing Leerdam by 0.01 at the bell. But with an excellent final lap, she clearly went into the lead, 1:13.19. Bowe, racing in the last pair, had the same opening as Golikova and Takagi, but lost nearly half a second in the first lap. But Golikova final lap had been almost three seconds slower than her first, which was exploited by Bowe, who clocked 1:14.61, a tenth faster than the ROC athlete, to win her first individual Olympic medal, a bronze.

In the next pair East Germany Sylvia Albrecht, who had been fourth at the 1979 World Sprints, skated steadily throughout to finish in 1:26.46. She was over a second behind Poulos-Mueller, but it would be good enough for the bronze medal, and after three pairs, the medals were decided. The sixth pair matched 500 champion Karin Enke and Beth Heiden, but they would finish fourth and fifth. Petrusyova would compete thru 1985, becoming one of the top skaters of the early 80s, winning the 1980 and 1981 World Championships, the 1982 World Sprints, and the 1981-82 European Championships.

But the 1,000 m seemed the perfect distance to set things straight, with heavily favored Karin Kania expected to win the gold. Defending Olympic champion Kania had won all four World Cup races in the distance this season, as well as the two 1000 ms at the World Sprint Championships. She had in fact won the World Sprint Championships six times in the past nine years. In addition, she had held the world record since 1986, last improving it at the Calgary World Cup in December 1987, to 1:18.11. The other medal contenders were the other two medallists in the 500 m, winner Bonnie Blair and runner-up Christa Rothenburger, and 1984 silver medallist Andrea Ehrig.
Ehrig started in the first pair, but her 1:19.32 was well outside the world record, which was not expected to hold up during the competition. In the third pair, Blair managed to beat Ehrig time by a full second, but her 1:18.31 was still two tenths off Kania rink record from December. Kania skated in the next pair. She started more consevatively than Blair, trailing the American split by half a second at the bell. But the former World Allround Champion had a much better final lap, gaining a full second on Blair. This gave her the lead, while lowering her own world record to 1:17.70. But Kania still had to wait for her teammate Rothenburger in the next pair. A typical sprinter, she got off at the same pace as Blair, meaning she had a half-second lead on Kania at 600 m. While Rothenburger also faded in the final lap, she did manage to hold on to her lead, and squeeze out 1:17.65, lowering the world record even further.
Rothenburger, whose world record would stand for nearly a decade, would win a third Olympic medal later in the year. At the Seoul Summer Olympics, she participated in the women track cycling sprint, gaining a silver medal. That made her the first person to win medals in the Winter and Summer Olympics in the same year. Since the Winter and Summer Games are no longer held in the same year, she will likely remain the only person to have achieved this.

Germany Anni Friesinger had won the 2003 and 2004 World Championships, and was runner-up in 2005. The crowd favorite was veteran Chiara Simionato, winner of the first 1000 m at the World Sprints just weeks before the Games. The other 1000 m that weekend had been won by the 500 m Olympic champion and World Sprint champion, Svetlana Boyarkina-Zhurova, although she was not generally considered a 1000 m specialist. From North America, Cindy Klassen and Jennifer Rodriguez were also highly considered, with three Dutch women, Marianne Timmer (1998 Olympic Champion), Barbara de Loor (2005 World Champion) and Ireen WÃ¼st (winner of the 3000 m at Torino), considered as outsiders for a medal.
Not regularly skating the 1000 m, Cindy Klassen was drawn early in the program, lowering Friesinger track record from earlier that season to 1:16.09. Fellow Canadian Kristina Groves faced Marianne Timmer a few pairs later. Timmer had been frustrated earlier in the Olympics, having been disqualified for two false starts in the 500 m. She opened out faster than Klassen, and held on to her lead in the last lap, beating the leading time by just 0.04 seconds.
Pair after pair failed to improve Timmer time, with 2002 Champion Witty doing no better than 27th, and favourite Simionato placing only 13th. In the last pair, Anni Friesinger seemed headed for the gold, clocking the same split as Klassen, and known for her strong last lap.

Brooks-Potter time, however, would not be recognized, having been skated in the North American packstyle format, and neither would be the winning time in the final.
The Canadian women were less fortunate in the final, with 500 m winner Wilson tripping in sight of the finish line, and placing last, while Brooks-Potter came only fourth. Instead, the final was won by Elizabeth Dubois of the USA, with Hattie Donaldson second and Dorothy Franey third.

Her compatriot Sabine VÃ¶lker then again improved the time at World Cup on the Olympic ice, clocking 1:14.06. In addition to these women, defending champion Marianne Timmer (Netherlands) and Jennifer Rodriguez had also won World Cup races during the ongoing season.
Timmer was the first to beat 1:15, well below her Olympic Record from 1998. Next up was Witty, who faced 500 m champion Catriona Le May Doan. The Canadian went off very quickly, and was still leading at the bell. But while Le May slowed down in the final lap, Witty finished very quickly (28.90), and broke the 1:14 barrier for a world record of 1:13.83. Her final lap time was only beaten by Rodriguez in the next pair (28.61), but her first 600 m had been slower, and she ended with 1:14.24. Sabine VÃ¶lker then seemed set to match Witty time, but narrowly missed it, coming home in 1:13.93. As Garbrecht also failed on the final lap, the title went to Witty. That came as a surprise, as Witty had needed to cut back on training all season. According to Witty, that was due to mononucleosis, but she later revealed a different reason. She had been sexually abused as a child by a family friend, and had experienced a lot of trouble dealing with this emotionally in the run-up to the Salt Lake Games.

Young started in the ninth pair and at 600 metres was ahead of both their paces, but she faded on the final lap, finishing in 1:29.14, and dropped down to the bronze medal, with Averina winning gold and Poulos the silver. Young bronze gave her a full set in Innsbruck, with gold in the 500, followed by a silver in the 1,500.

She had also won all six international 1000 ms during the current season, including two at the World Sprint Championships in January, where she also took the overall title.
Starting in the second pair, she quickly did away with any hopes other competitors might have had. With 1:18.74, she record her second fastest 1,000 m ever (only bested by her 1988 bronze medal time). Her pairmate was Ye Qiaobo, two-time silver medallist in 1992. After winning the 1993 World Sprint Championships, Ye had been considered a title candidate for Lillehammer, but a knee injury foiled her plans. Not fully recovered, the Chinese skater was glad to win her third Olympic medal in 1:20.22, which was enough for bronze. As expected, the third medalist came from Germany. However, where former World Champions Monique Garbrecht or Angela Hauck had been favored for the medal, it was Anke Baier who took home the silver medal. While Baier had collected several World Cup medals in the 1993 season, she had not done as well in the Olympic year, and her medal was therefore surprising.
Blair fifth Olympic title made her the first American woman to win five gold medals. She also became the second most successful female speed skater, ranking only behind Lidiya Skoblikova six golds from 1960 and 1964.

Her time would hold up for the silver medal. But in the seventh pair, Skoblikova recorded 1:33.2, although she had been behind Yegorova splits at both 200 and 600 metres. Nobody else was close to those two times, as Finland Kaija Mustonen finished in 1:34.8 in the fifth pair. The next day, Skoblikova would finish her gold medal sweep by winning the 3,000 metres. For now, this was her fifth Olympic gold medal, counting two from Squaw Valley. Mustonen was somewhat of a surprise as, prior to 1964, she had never come close to the podium in any distance at a previous international tournament. But only the day before this race, she had won a silver medal in the 1,500 metres, giving her two Olympic medals in Innsbruck.

In the Olympic season, though, Bergsma showed less form. She did win one World Cup, but that was due to a fall by Nao Kodaira, winner of the Olympic 500 m in Pyeongchang. Kodaira had in fact won the other three races she had participated in, and had also claimed the world record, lowering it to 1:12.09. Various other skaters had shown strong performances, including Vanessa Herzog, Jorien ter Mors, Marrit Leenstra and Miho Takagi.

Heather Richardson had won three of the four World Cup races earlier in the season, the other going to her teammate Brittany Bowe, in a race that saw Bowe capture the World Record (1:12.58). Defending Olympic Champion Christine Nesbitt had also won world titles in 2011 and 2012, but had not been a contender since and was not considered for the title. The 2013 World Champion, Russian Olga Fatkulina was favored, especially given her silver medal performance in the 500 m. The 3,000 m champion Ireen WÃ¼st had placed second behind Fatkulina in 2013, and was also assumed to be able to win. In the end though, none of these won gold.
The gold medallist already raced before the ice preparation break, which came after 9 pairs. In pair 7, Chinese race Zhang Hong came to the ice. Already a surprising 3rd after one heat in the 500 m, Zhang was feared for her fast laps, which often âcompensatedâ for her poor starts. Nevertheless, she had already won two medals at the World Sprint Championships, including a silver behind the now injured Yu Jing several weeks before the Olympics. In her Olympic 1,000 m, Zhang started well, and her first lap was unrivalled at 27.09. Combined with a closing lap that only one skater would better (28.99), this gave her an amazing 1:14.02, just narrowly slower than Richardson lowland world record. Pair after pair failed to approach it. Only in the 16th pair did Margot Boer and Fatkulina seriously attack Zhang time. The Russian opened faster and had a great first lap to lead Zhang time by 2 tenths at the bell. But Fatkulina paid dearly for her fast start, and lost all of her advantage in the last 200 m, as she also saw Margot Boer pass her. The Dutch racer, 3rd in the 500 m, recorded 1:14.90, which would eventually earn her a second bronze medal. WÃ¼st fought off Bowe with the best final lap of the field to get to 1:14.69, the second best time of the day. Eagerly awaiting the final pair in the inner field, Zhang Hong celebrated China first Olympic gold medal in speed skating ever, after three silver and three bronze medals.

He had clocked a 2:18.8 nine days earlier in Davos, and all of the other season best times were at least 1.8 seconds slower. In fact, Thunberg had not lost a 1500 m all season, winning this distance at the Finnish, European and World Championships. Behind him, the Norwegians were expected to divide the medals, with the Americans as outsiders.
The Americans opened, with Eddie Murphy (2:25.9) and Irving Jaffee (2:26.7) setting the pace. The third American, John OâNeil Farrell, was beaten by Roald Larsen of Norway, who also moved in front. Two more Norwegians followed, Olympic 5000 m champion Ivar Ballangrud and Wollert Nygren. The latter, a substitute for the sick Staksrud, had done well in Davos, but disappointed in St. Moritz. Not so for Ballangrud, who took the lead with a very decent 2:22.6. He didnât have to wait long to see what that time was worth. The very next race paired Thunberg and Bernt Evensen, the fastest of the Norwegians in the )metric mile). The two fought a great race, and were still level coming out of the final bend. Thunberg then emerged as the better sprinter, winning in 2:21.1, eight tenths ahead of Evensen.
The twelfth place of Charlie Gorman is somewhat contentious. He showed up late for the start, but was allowed to skate against Siem Heiden in the final pair, but out of competition.

Koss was the defending champion, and he had won the pre-Olympic World Cup on the Hamar rink back in December. But he faced stiff competition from both his own country and the Netherlands. Kossâ team mate Ãdne SÃ¸ndrÃ¥l, had won two World Cup races earlier in the season, and had finished second behind Koss in the Albertville Games. Of the Dutch skaters, Falko Zandstra and Rintje Ritsma had the best chances. Zandstra had won the Davos World Cup, while Ritsma had won the distance at the European Championships in January in Hamar. Ritsma had then bettered the world record - which still dated from the 1988 Olympics - to 1:51.60.
Koss was the first of these favorites to race. Skating a final lap that was unheard of (29.38), he managed to beat Ritsma world best mark by 0.31 seconds, setting it at 1:51.29. Next up was SÃ¸ndrÃ¥l. While a sprinter, he couldnât match Koss splits early on, and never came close to his compatriot time, despite setting a personal best of 1:53.13. In the next pair, it was Zandstra. At the bell, the Dutch World Allround Champion was about equal with Koss, but his final lap was over a second slower than the Norwegian. Ritsma, going in pair six, met with the same fate. Leading by two tenths at 1,100 m, he lost a lot in the last 400 m, ending up with 1:51.99, slightly outside his own former world record. At the victory press conference, Johann Olav Koss announced he would donate his victory reward to the victims of the war in Bosnia, and especially Sarajevo, the host of the 1984 Winter Olympics that had been ravaged by war.

In the second pairing, Soviet skater Sergey Khlebnikov, the 1982 World Sprints champion, finished in 1:58.83, almost two seconds better than Engelstad. The time would hold until Canada GaÃ©tan Boucher started in the 10th pair. Boucher had already won the 1,000 only two days earlier, and he was almost 1/2-second better than Khlebnikov, finishing in 1:58.36. For Boucher it was his third medal of the Sarajevo Winter Olympics, as he had also won a bronze in the 500. Khlebnikov time held up for the silver, matching his silver from the 1,000.

Other skaters were not considered to have much of a chance, especially since Ballangrud had tied the legendary World Record of Oscar Mathisen, 2:17.4, at the World Championships in Davos (Switzerland). All other fast times of the season had also been posted by Norwegians: Harry Haraldsen, Charles Mathiesen and Hans Engnestangen.
Ballangrud was the first of the top skaters to ride, and his pair with Leo Freisinger (USA) was a great duel. The two skaters exchanged the lead a few times, with Ballangrud leading at the last turn. Freisinger was looking to close in with a final inner curve, but could not keep up, and the Norwegian posted 2:20.2. Another close pair followed, between Mathiesen and Max Stiepl of Austria. A silver medallist in the 1500 m at the European Championships, Mathiesen kept a high tempo, being trailed by Stiepl for the first two laps. He then took off, while keeping his 1 second lead on Ballangrud. His 2:19.2 was an excellent time, and a new Olympic Record - Ballangrud was beaten, the surprise of the day. Harry Haraldsen then seemed to be blazing towards a top position as well, but this was mostly caused by his poor opponent. He caught Belgian Charles de Ligne on the final straightaway, a very rare occurrence in an event of just under four laps. In fact, De Ligne is the worst speed skater in Olympic history. His times in the 500 m (with fall), 1500 m and 5000 m (disqualified) are the worst ever recorded at the Olympics, while the ice in Garmisch-Partenkirchen was of good quality. Only one skater has done worse than De Ligne, in the 10000 m. However, Buddy Solem (USA) had the misfortune of skating on a thawing rink at the 1948 Games.
The top four times were secure until the next to last pair, which included Birger Wasenius, winner of the silver medal the day before. He kept up with the pace of the leading Norwegian couple until 700 metres, but then had to yield. He was trailing Freisinger third position with a lap to go, but closed that gap to win his second medal of the Games.

Nuis, the defending Olympic champion, had had a difficult season. After summer trouble with myocarditis following COVID-19 vaccination, he had struggled in national and international competition, and had missed qualification for the 1,000 m, which he had also won in 2018. He came into the event having beaten Krol both at the Dutch Olympic Trials and at the European Championships in January.
The season World Cup races had been won by mass start expert Joey Mantia (twice), Chinese hope Ning Zhongyan and 2018 silver medalist Kim Min-Seok. Of the Dutch duo, Krol had only managed a single third place.
Krol was the first of the favorites to skate, in pair 10. He went all-out and shattered the leading time by Sergey Trofimov by nearly two seconds, finishing in 1:43.55, while his pair mate Peder Kongshaug moved into second with 1:44.39. Their times were tested in the very next pair, with Kim facing Nuis. Both went off at a slower pace, and Nuis was a tenth behind his compatriot at the bell. But Nuis had saved enough strength for the final lap (28.44), leading him to an Olympic Record time of 1:43.21. A second behind was Kim, who recorded the third time in 1:44.24. None of the remaining six skaters came close to the leading trio, with Connor Howe coming closest at 1:44.86 and fifth place.
Nuisâ back-to-back gold medals in the 1,500 m marked the first repeat victory since Johann Olav Koss in 1992-94, and the fourth time ever (after Clas Thunberg [1924-28] and Yevgeny Grishin [1956-60]).

Winning titles in 2013, 2015 and 2016, and being runner-up in 2017, he was the red hot favorite for the gold in PyeongChang. His performances earlier in the season had only confirmed this status, winning all four World Cups he contested. But as with many Russians, Yuskov was barred from competing at the 2018 Olympics due to his doping history. As a junior, he had been caught for marijuana usage in 2007, and had served a four-month ban. This left the role of favorite to Dutchman Kjeld Nuis. The World Champion of 2017 had not had a great season however, and had initially not even qualified for the Dutch World Cup team, although he later convincingly won the Dutch Olympic Trials. A host of others were considered for the medals, including 2014 runner-up Koen Verweij, Sverre Lunde Pedersen, Vincent de HaÃ®tre and Joey Mantia.
A surprise qualifier at the Dutch Olympic Trials, Patrick Roest raced in the early pairs, setting a convincing 1:44.86. Nuis, however, comfortably bettered that mark 10 pairs later, recording 1:44.01 before stopping to wait for the final pairs.

Youngster Falko Zandstra had won two World Cup races and the distance at the European Championships, where he had taken the overall title. The third World Cup of the season had been won by another Dutchman, Rintje Ritsma. The third man on the team was Leo Visser, who had dominated the 1989 speed skating season. He had retired to focus on his pilot studies, but had returned to complete his prize cabinet with an Olympic gold medal, having narrowly lost the 5,000 m gold in 1988. Behind the Dutch, Norwegian skaters Johann Olav Koss and Ãdne SÃ¸ndrÃ¥l had also posted consistent top results. But Koss, the 1990 and 1991 World Allround Champion, had recently suffered health problems. A little over a week before the Olympic 1,500 m, he had been in hospital for an inflamed pancreas. His participation in the 5,000 m (seventh) had been considered near miraculous.
The start of the race was delayed due to poor conditions, but even then ice conditions were poor. Falko Zandstra, first of the favorites to ride, had an unimpressive last lap, and his 1:56.96 was not considered medal-worthy. After an ice preparation, this was proven by Leo Visser, who skated 1:54.90 in a solid race. As Ritsma stayed well behind with 1:55.70, Visser hopes for a medal grew. Johann Olav Koss then copied Visser lap times in heat 8, and a slightly faster last lap brought him home in 1:54.81. As Visser headed off the track in disappointment, a second Norwegian also beat his time. SÃ¸ndrÃ¥l, too, recorded the same splits, but only just missed out on the gold with 1:54.85. While Koss celebrated his remarkable victory, Visser closed out his skating career by throwing his skates into the audience.

Between them they had won the distance at most of the recent international tournaments, including the 1966 and 1967 World and European Championships. But the 1968 Europeans had been held shortly before the Winter Olympics and that distance was won by Soviet skater Eduard Matusevich. Another contender was the world record holder, Magne Thomassen of Norway, who had recorded 2:02.5 in Davos only 11 days previously.
Schenk and Matusevich were the first favorites off, together in the second pair, and Schenk posted 2:05.0 for the others to shoot at, while Matusevich trailed in 2:06.1, and would eventually place eighth. Verkerk was in the sixth pair and he was right on pace through 700 metres, and slightly ahead at 1,100. He finished in 2:03.4, which would easily win him the gold medal. Five pairs later, Norway Ivar Eriksen came through to tie Schenk in 2:05.0. He was followed by Thomassen, who skated in the 12th pair, and finished in 2:05.1, just outside the medals.
Verkerk had been around since 1963 at an international level and his career would last until 1974, during which he would win the 1966 and 1967 World Championships and the 1967 European Championship. He would finish his career with four Olympic medals, but this would be his only gold. Schenk would soon become the greatest skater in the world, and one of the greatest ever. In 1972 at Sapporo, he would gold medals in all but the 500 metres.

At both major Championships in 1947, the 1500 m had been won by Norway Sverre Farstad. On both occasions, he beat Sweden Ãke Seyffarth, the 1947 European Champion. But neither had been undefeated in the 1948 season. Although Farstad had won his distance at the Norwegian Championships, he had been defeated by Odd Lundberg and Gunnar Konsmo, while Seyffarth had been bested by compatriot GÃ¶the Hedlund. Hedlund had in fact clocked the best time of the season, setting 2.18,4 in a test race in St. Moritz shortly before the Games.
Again, the weather in St. Moritz was ideal, still and sunny, allowing for fine ice conditions and fast times. The first favorite in competition was Farstad. He sped to an excellent 2.17,6, shattering the Olympic Record as well as his personal best. This time seemed hard to beat. While Lundberg could go under 2.20 with 2.18,6, Hedlund couldnât approach his time from earlier in the week and only managed 2.20,7. Then Seyffarth started in pair 14. He went all out from the start, with the fastest opening of the day. At the bell, he was still leading over Farstad, but then started to fade. Farstad final lap had been strong, and Seyffarth couldnât match it, finishing half a second behind the Norwegian. There was one more skater that beat 2.20 â World Champion Lassi Parkkinen â but his time was not good enough for a podium spot.
Hjalmar Andersen, Henry Wahl, and Sverre Farstad were known as the âFalken Trioâ, named after their Trondheim club, SK Falk.

Dutchman Kees Verkerk started late, in the 21st pair, and matched Antson splits thru 1,100 metres, but finished slightly slower, in 2:10.6, and earned the silver medal. In 1992, when Estonia returned to the Olympic Games as an independent nation, Ants Antson was chosen to carry the Estonian flag at the Albertville Winter Olympic opening ceremony.

The first official sub-1:50 record was set in a Berlin World Cup by Ids Postma, only to be bettered by Kevin Overland later the same day. At the Dutch Olympic Trials, Rintje Ritsma again lowered it, to 1:48.88. Other favorites included the other Dutch skaters (Bos and Hersman (who replaced Wennemars after his injury in the 500 m) and Ãdne SÃ¸ndrÃ¥l, Olympic silver medalist back in 1992, and runner-up at the two most recent World Championships.
The first to approach 1:50 was American KC Boutiette, who had converted from inline skating and had competed at the 1994 Games as a substitute for Dan Jansen in this event. His time of 1:50.04 held out until the last three pairs, with Jan Bos beating it first with 1:49.75. Next up were Postma and SÃ¸ndrÃ¥l, who fought out an exciting duel. Postma got off to a better start, but the Norwegian caught up, and at 1,100 m, the two were exactly equal. With Postma having the final inner curve, he seemed to have the advantage and beat SÃ¸ndrÃ¥l. But Postma stumbled slightly, and SÃ¸ndrÃ¥l had a very powerful last lap. He broke the world record by more than a second (1:47.87), with Postma also finishing well below the old mark. Only Ritsma, runner-up in 1994 and Overland were remaining, and Ritsma splits matched those of the two leaders. However, like Postma, he was unable to keep up with SÃ¸ndrÃ¥l pace in the final lap, and had to settle for a bronze. SÃ¸ndrÃ¥l world record wouldnât last long, as the Norwegian broke it himself by nearly 1.5 seconds at the World Single Distance Championships in Calgary later that year.

After being tied by Boris Shilkov, it was beaten by almost a second by Valentin Chaikin. In the absence of the USSR skaters, there was one clear favourite for the gold, Wim van der Voort of the Netherlands. He had won the 1,500 m at the 1951 World Championships and the 1951 and 1952 Europeans. In the international race at Hamar a week prior to the Olympics, he had also claimed the 1,500 m. Not competing in that race was his biggest opponent, Hjalmar Andersen. Andersen was the dominant all-round skater at that time, and had placed second behind Van der Voort during his distance victories. In fact, third place also seemed certain; at the same three championships, the bronze had been taken by Roald Aas, also from Norway.
Andersen was drawn in the first pair, which was considered to be unfavorable, giving Van der Voort the advantage of knowing the Norwegian time. Cheered on loudly by Bislett, Andersen clocked 2.20,4 â not his best Bislett time, but ice conditions were not optimal. But track conditions deteriorated as it began to snow after a few more pairs. Van der Voort, skating in pair five, seemed not to mind the weather, opening in the same time as Andersen. His next two laps were somewhat slower, but the Dutchman was known for his strong final lap. As expected, he closed in on the leading time, but not by enough: 2.20,6.
As the snow continued to fall, the other medal hopefuls were unable to approach the leading times. Lassi Parkkinen (Finland) and Carl-Erik Asplund (Sweden), both stranded at seconds behind the top duo. As expected, the âbest of the restâ was Roald Aas, who finished a second behind Van der Voort. The snow halted during an ice preparation following pair 13, but all the favorites had already skated at that point, except for Ivar Martinsen. But with 2.23,4, he tied for 8th, together with Ericsson of Sweden, who also started on a clear track.

Ren had also won the last two World Cup races of the season, with the others going to 35-year-old Yuri Confortola and Semyon Yelistratov. Veteran star Charles Hamelin had claimed two of the world titles since the 2018 Olympics (2018 and 2021), while the 2019 champion Im Hyo-Jun was not in competition after a harassment scandal and nationality change.
The quarter-finals proceeded without major incidents or upsets. The first two semi-finals were also fairly uneventful, but the third, which featured Ren, Hamelin, Confortola, as well as Shaoang Liu, bronze medallist in the 1,000 m, and Park Jang-Hyuk, who had earned three World Cup bronzes earlier in the year, saw some drama. Early in the race, Hamelin blocked Confortola and Treacy in an overtake attempt, causing the Italian to crash. Similarly, Ren arm blocked Galiakhmetov, meaning both Ren and Hamelin were penalized. All of the five other racers qualified for the final, bringing that to a massive 10-person field.
There were no penalties in the final, which saw a lot of lead changes in the opening laps. With 9 laps to go, Hwang Dae-Heon, moved up from the middle of the pack to the lead, passing all on the outside within a lap. Closely followed by Steven Dubois and Yelistratov, the Korean then gradually increased the pace, making it very hard for the others to pass. Despite furious attempts by among others Yelistratov, the top three did not change again. It was Hwang second Olympic medal, having won silver in the 2018 500 m, while Yelistratov retained the bronze he had also won in PyeongChang.

Boris Shilkov had won the distance and the all-around at the 1954 World and European Championships. Norwegian Hroar Elvenes had won the distance at the 1955 Europeans. At the 1955 World Championships, Soviet skater Oleg Goncharenko won the 1,500 but he would only compete in longer distances, winning bronze medals in both the 5 and 10K in Cortina.
In the first pair was Finland Toivo Salonen, who was a top sprinter but better at 500 metres. He had won the 500 at the 1953 Europeans and Worlds and the 1955 World Championships. Salonen posted 2:09.4, the second fastest time ever, which was a formidable mark for the other skaters to look at, and he had placed second in Davos behind Mikhaylov world record race. In fact nobody approached it until his teammate, Juhani JÃ¤rvinen finished the ninth pair in 2:09.7. Grishin was in the 11th pair. He started slightly slower than Salonen (26.5 to 26.6) but caught him by 700 metres and powered ahead to finish in a world record 2:08.6. Mikhaylov was in the next pair. He led Grishin pace at 700 and 1,100 metres, but could not finish as strongly, and also crossed the line in 2:08.6. The two would share the gold medal, with Salonen holding on for the bronze and JÃ¤rvinen in fourth place. Elvenes had the misfortune to be drawn in the final (27th) pair, and finished only 24th.

A silver medallist in 1,500 m four years earlier, Davis had since won the 2007 and 2009 world titles, as well as the 1,500 m World Cup of 2008 and 2009. In March 2009, he had become the first man to break 1:42 in the event, subsequently lowering the world record to 1:41.04 early in the 2009/2010 season. Coming into the Olympic race, the only âblemishâ on his record was the loss to fellow American Chad Hedrick in the Calgary World Cup earlier in the season.
The first skater to approach the track record, set by Davis at the 2009 World Championships, was Ivan Skobrev, bronze medallist in the 5,000 m. In his breakthrough season, the Russian outpaced home favorite Denny Morrison to cross the line after 1:46.42. But that mark didnât even survive the next pair, which featured Mark Tuitert and HÃ¥vard BÃ¸kko. Several years back, Tuitert had won two 1,500 m World Cup titles (2004/2005) and the 2004 European Championship, but he had struggled since. BÃ¸kko had been the most consistent performer behind Davis on the World Circuit, taking 2nd place in the first two races. The duel was a fast race, with both Tuitert and BÃ¸kko both going well under Skobrev splits. The two took the leading positions, Tuitert with 1:45.57, BÃ¸kko with 1:46.13.
In the final pair, Davis took off with a pace just slightly off Tuitert. But Davis, usually known for his faster closing laps, now lost ground to the Dutchman in the final 800 m.

One of An opponents, defending champion Apolo Anton Ohno, was surprisingly eliminated in the semi-finals. The Koreans expressed regret over this, as they wanted to take revenge for Ohno win in the event back in 1,500, when Kim Dong-Seong had been controversially disqualified in favor of Ohno. But the Koreans did not care much, as they easily won the competition. An won the race, while his compatriot Lee Ho-Seok finished second.

Gulyayev had also won one World Cup during the season, in Innsbruck. But the leader in the 1,500 m World Cup standings was AndrÃ© Hoffmann, who had not been very successful until the start of the season, when he won the first two World Cups. Also performing well in recent races were Eric Flaim and Michael Hadschieff, who had placed fourth and sixth in the Olympic 1,000 m.
The competition started with Flaim breaking the world record, taking off 0.38 seconds and setting it at 1:52.12. But while that time was easily faster than Gulyayev, the record lasted only for a few minutes. AndrÃ© Hoffmann started much faster than the American, leading by half a second at the bell. Hoffmann faded somewhat in the final lap, but an advantage of 0.06 seconds remained: 1:52.06. This time proved too fast to beat, even for Hadschieff (1:52.31) and Zhelezovsky (1:52.63).
For Hoffmann, his Olympic title would remain his most important feat. Eric Flaim, by contrast, would close out the season by becoming World Allround Champion. In 1994, he would win a second Olympic silver medal, this time in short track speed skating, becoming the first Olympian to medal in these two sports. Michael Hadschieff bronze medal was the first for Austria in speed skating since the 1936 Winter Games.

Thunberg was the first of the favorites to hit the ice, with no serious times posted at that moment. His opponent was Roald Larsen, who had the same time as Thunberg in the 500 m and shared the bronze. They would produce the fastest race of the competition, Thunberg winning in 2:20.8. Next up was Norwegian Sigurd Moen, who would later be an eternal 4th place at international championships. He did make the Olympic podium, even if his time was nearly five seconds slower than Thunberg and more than 3 seconds slower than Larsen. Of the remaining medal contenders, Asser Wallenius fell, while 500 m champion Jewtraw blew himself up with a quick start. A fast race between Julius Skutnabb (FIN) and Harald StrÃ¸m (NOR) was only sufficient for 4th and 5th.

Schenk had already set 15 world records in his career, and was World Champion in 1970-71 and European Champion in 1970 and 1972. The 1,500 was probably his best distance â he held the world record of 1:58.7, had won a silver medal at the 1968 Winter Olympics when he was still young, and was by 1972 rarely beaten in the event.
In the sixth pair, Norway Roar GrÃ¸nvold and Sweden GÃ¶ran Claeson moved into the 1-2 spots, finishing in 2:04.26 and 2:05.89 respectively. GrÃ¸nvold had already won a silver in the 5,000 in Sapporo, and his time would earn him another silver, with Claeson holding on for the bronze. But then the king appeared two pairs later. Schenk started at a moderate pace, but was comfortably ahead at 1,100 metres and finished in 2:02.96 for his second gold medal in Sapporo.
Schenk would eventually win three gold medals in Sapporo, failing only in the 500, matching the feats of Clas Thunberg in 1924, Ivar Ballangrud in 1936, and Hjalmar Andersen in 1952. He turned professional after the 1972 Winter Olympics. In his career, Schenk set 18 world records, won eight major international tournaments, and his distance wins are too numerous to mention.

The third race was somewhat more exciting, with Sweden Ingvar Lindberg trying to break away from the pack. He was only caught at 150 m from the finish line, but was then overtaken by the entire field.
Alex Hurd took the lead on the first lap of the final, then swerved to the side to let 500 m champion Shea ahead. On the second lap, Ray Murray took over. The American faded on the final lap, being passed by Shea. Herb Taylor followed close-by in second, but tripped over an ice bump and fell. This left a comfortable lead for Shea, who won his second gold of the Games, followed by the three Canadians. After the race, the Norwegian delegation pointed out to the referee the rule that the time in the final of an event should be faster than the average of the heats contested. Shea time had been 10 seconds slower than the required average, but the referee chose to ignore this rule.
Jack Shea, who competed in the Lake Placid Olympics while on leave from Dartmouth College, would later become the patriarch of an Olympic family. His son Jim participated in the 1964 Olympics as a Nordic skier, while his grandson, Jim, Jr., competed in skeleton in 2002.

The latter had shared his victory with Jakko Jan Leeuwangh, who didnât even make the Dutch team, as had Martin Hersman and Erben Wennemars, also World Cup medalists earlier in the season.
Not among those favorites was Jochem Uytdehaage, whose selection at the Dutch Olympic Trials had been somewhat controversial due to his lack of previous achievements at the distance. But with an Olympic gold medal from the 5,000 m in the pocket, the Dutchman skated the best 1,500 m of his life. With the best final lap of the competition, he broke Lee Gyu-Hyeok world record and lowered it to 1:44.57. Of the pre-race favorites, only one man was able to beat this time. Having finished second behind Uytdehaage in the 5,000 m, Derek Parra now took home the gold. A former inline skating World Champion, he had switched to speed skating in 1996 for a chance to compete in the Olympics. Having been an alternate in 1998, his results slowly improved, winning his first international prize at the 2001 World Single Distance Champions; a silver medal in the 1,500 m. He confirmed his status in that event by winning a World Cup race in November 2001, his only international win prior to his Olympic title.
The duel for the bronze was an interesting one, between SÃ¸ndrÃ¥l and Joey Cheek. Primarily a sprinter, Cheek had taken off incredibly fast, leading Parra splits by four tenths at the bell, and SÃ¸ndrÃ¥l by a full 1.75 seconds.

The co-defending champion, Yevgeny Grishin, was back and was a top sprinter. The other 1956 champion, Yury Mikhaylov, did not compete in Squaw Valley. The world record holder with 2:06.2 was Finnish skater Juhani JÃ¤rvinen, who had set the record in March 1959 in a pre-Olympic meet in Squaw Valley. He had won the distance at the 1959 European Championships, and was second at the 1959 World Championships. At the recent 1960 World and European Championships, the distance had been won by Boris Stenin and Knut Johannesen, respectively, although Johannesen was normally considered better at the longer distances.
The day of the race was clear but with very high winds, as in the 5,000 the day before, which hampered the skaters and slowed down the times a bit. A large field of 48 skaters answered the gun. Among the favorites, Stenin was off first, in the sixth pair. He started well and was the first skater to pass 700 metres in under a minute, and finished in 2:11.5 to take the lead. The time held up until the ninth pair when Norway Roald Aas finished in 2:10.4. Aas was well off Stenin pace even thru 1,100 metres, but finished very strongly. Aas skated alongside JÃ¤rvinen, who was behind Aas throughout and could not match his final lap, finishing in 2:13.1, which would place him tied for fifth. Grishin started in the 13th pair, and set the fastest pace. His splits were 26 seconds, 58 seconds, and 1:32, all the fastest of the event, but he could not match Aas finish, and he crossed the line in 2:10.4. The times would hold up with Grishin and Aas tieing for first, with Stenin third. Amazingly, the event had co-champions as it had in 1956.
Aas was not new to the podium at the Olympics as he had been the bronze medalist in this event in 1952 at Oslo. He had had a solid international career since 1951, finishing third in all-around at the 1957 and 1960 European Championships and the 1958 World Championships. He retired after this, his greatest triumph. Grishin had been competing internationally since 1954. Among the greatest sprinters ever, he was almost never beaten at 500 metres, and in the 1,500, had won the distance at the 1955 and 1957 Europeans, in addition to his two Olympic golds. He continued to race after Squaw Valley, though less frequently after 1963, but would appear at the 1964 and 1968 Winter Olympics, winning a silver in the 500 in 1964.

Off past records, the favorite among those present had to be David Munson, the 1904 champion in both the IC4A and the AAU meet, but he would prove to be a disappointment.
The race began with Harvey Cohn and Peter Deer taking the lead, with Bill Verner third for most of the first lap.  Deer dropped back on the second circuit and at the bell, it was Cohn, Verner and Jim Lightbody, in that order, with Munson struggling in fourth place.  On the backstretch, Lightbody made easy work of the field and coasted in a victor by six yards, Verner held onto second and was followed by Lacey  Hearn who closed fast to take third.  Lightbody time was 4:05.4, which was a )world record,) but was equivalent only to a 4:25.7 mile, far inferior to the world amateur record of 4:15.6 held by Tom Conneff.

Deeper placements based on placements in earlier rounds, and best time skated.",na,"As is common in short track speed skating, the South Koreans were favored in this event. With Lee Ho-Seok, they entered the reigning world champion in the event. He was joined by two team mates, Seong Si-Baek and Lee Jeong-Su. The three Koreans demonstrated their might in the semi-finals, as they all won their respective heats. They were joined in the final by Apolo Anton Ohno (USA), the 2002 champion, Liang Wenhao (China), Olivier Jean (Canada), who qualified after being interfered with in the semi-finals, and J. R. Celski (USA).
With three men in the final, the Koreans were determined to make it a clean sweep. Their plan appeared to work perfectly, as they were occupying the first three places going into the final lap. While Lee Jeong-Su was leading, Lee Ho-Seok attempted to pass his two team mates on the inside of final curve. But he went too fast, and crashed out of the curve, dragging Seong along with him. Instead of three Koreans on the podium, only Lee Jeong-Su was left, who did take the gold. Behind him, Ohno and Celski took medals for the United States.
For Ohno, it was his sixth Olympic medal, the highest total for any short track skater, and also the highest for any American Winter Olympian (although Bonnie Blair, who he passed, had won more gold medals). Celski bronze medal was also remarkable. During the US Olympic Trials, he had crashed badly, severely cutting his thigh with his skate, which required some sixty stiches, and it seemed uncertain if he would skate again. With the help of Dr. Eric Heiden, Celski recovered in time for the Vancouver Olympics.
A notable participant in the B-final was Latvia Haralds Silovs. The 1,500 m European Champion for 2008 and 2009, he had competed in the 5,000 m on the long track earlier in the day, becoming the first Olympian to combine both speed skating variants at the same Games - and on the same day.

Deeper placements based on points earned in earlier rounds, and time in final round skated.",na,"After the hilarious finish of the 1,000 m, the second final of the men short track competitions again gave plenty to discuss. The field for the final contained most of the favorites: Japanese American teenager Apolo Anton Ohno, four-time World Champion Marc Gagnon of Canada, Kim Dong-Seong, the 1998 winner of the 1,000 m and four-fold European Champion Fabio Carta (Italy).
Halfway through the race, Kim kicked up the pace and took the lead. Ohno, meanwhile, remained in the back of the field for much of the race, emerging only with two laps to go. He first moved up to second place behind Kim. In the final lap, he then attempted to pass the South Korean on the inside. The two briefly touched, and Ohno waived his hands in the air signaling obstruction. Both continued to the finish line in full speed, the Korean seemingly taking the gold. But while Kim skated around with the Korean flag, it was announced that Kim was disqualified for cross-tracking, for obstructing Ohno who was trying to pass him. The call left Kim in disbelief on the ice, while Ohno ecstatically celebrated his victory with the crowd.
Disputed disqualifications are not uncommon in short track, and naturally one deciding the Olympic gold was hotly disputed. The referee decision fell badly with South Koreans, and Ohno and the IOC received thousands of e-mails and letters, some even containing death threats. Ohno was assigned body guards because of this, and still needs protection when competing in South Korea, where short track speed skating is a major sport. The impact of the decision was visible during the 2002 Football World Cup, held in South Korea and Japan. When Ahn Jung-Hwan scored the equaliser in a match between South Korea and the US, he celebrated his goal by making skating moves, later explaining the reference to Kim disqualification. Kim himself would bounce back in the best way possible. At the 2002 World Championships, after the Games, he won all four distances and the overall title - an unprecedented performance.

Sheffield Speed Skating Oval, Lake Placid",36 from 16 countries,na,na,"By the time the 1,500 started, Eric Heiden had won three gold medals and he was a safe bet in the 1,500. The 1,500 was one of his two best distances, with the 1,000. He had not been defeated internationally since the 1977 World All-Arounds, and in January 1980, had broken the world record, posting 1:54.79 in Davos only a month before the Olympics. His biggest competition was expected to come from two Norwegians, Jan Egil Storholt and Kai Arne Stenshjemmet. Storholt had been second at the last three World All-Arounds, to Heiden, and was the 1977 and 1979 European All-Around Champion, but his 1,500 PR was 1:55.18, not far from Heiden world record, and the previous world mark, but it had been set at the Kazakh speed factory of Medeo. Stenshjemmet usually had trouble beating Storholt, placing second to him at the 1977 and 1979 Europeans, and third at the 1979 World All-Around, and his 1,500 best was much slower than Storholt, at 1:57.50. Storholt started in the first pair and posted 1:57.95 on the slow Lake Placid ice. Nobody in the second or third pairs bettered that time, and it came down to Heiden and Stenshjemmet, skating together in the fourth pair. Heiden set off at a mad pace, posting 24.49 for the first 300 metres and was well ahead. But near the end of the second lap, at about 600 metres, he hit a rut in the ice, and almost fell, having to put down a hand to steady himself. It seemingly cost him up to a second in time, but it mattered little, as he recovered easily and defeated Stenshjemmet by slightly over 11/4 seconds in 1:55.44. Stenshjemmet time would be good enough for his second silver medal, adding to one from the 5K. Skating in the next pair, another Norwegian, Terje Andersen, posted 1:56.92 for the bronze medal. Heiden now had four gold medals, tieing him with Lidiya Skoblikova , who in 1964 had won all four women speed skating events. He had only the 10K left to conquer.

A full list would be hard to replicate, but weâll mention 2012 World Champion and 1,000 m silver medallist Denny Morrison, 2011 World Champion HÃ¥vard BÃ¸kko, defending Olympic champion Mark Tuitert, 2013 World Cup winner Zbigniew BrÃ³dka and 1,000 m winner Stefan Groothuis.
The race got serious in pair 13, when defending champion Tuitert put 1:45.42 on the clock, a major attempt to defend his title. It was beaten two pairs later, as Morrison bettered it to 1:45.22, leaving BÃ¸kko behind him. Pair 17 saw Davis take the ice against BrÃ³dka. With all eyes on the American, it was the Pole who won that pair. Eager to beat his pairmate, he recorded a typical race that saw him lose 1 second of pace with every full lap, but his 1:45.00 was a new track record. The time remained unassailed until the last pair, which pitted Verweij and Mantia against each other. Mantia was quickly out of contention, but not Verweij. Having started a little slower than BrÃ³dka, he closed in on the Pole in his last lap, which would be the fastest closing lap, save for 4th place finisher Yuskov. At the finish line, the clock again stopped at 1:45.00 - a tie for first. Verweij and BrÃ³dka looked at the scoreboard in doubt to wait for the verdict on the thousandths of seconds. After nervewrecking moments for both, Verweij was recorded at 1:45.009, exactly 0.003 slower than BrÃ³dka. The latter celebrated his country first ever Olympic gold in the sport, earned by the smallest ever margin between gold and silver in Olympic speed skating.

After her title, Zhou was naturally ecstatic, and in an interview with Chinese television, she thanked her parents, who had supported her sports dreams, despite their poverty. While this would not have caused raised eyebrows in most of the world, it caused a stir in China, where athletes generally thank their country. IOC member Yu Zaiqing was quoted as saying: )It fine to thank your mom and dad [for the gold medal] but one needs to thank the country first and foremost), referring to the country government funded sports system. But Yu comment received a lot of criticism in China, notably from the younger internet generation, who preferred Zhou more natural and enthusiastic response.

The latter had recently established herself as the dominant female skater. In 1991, she had won the World Allround Championships with three distance wins, and she had already won four consecutive European titles (1989-1992), winning the 1,500 m every time. But Hunyady, who had married an Austrian to escape from her native Hungary, had beaten Niemann at the Collalbo World Cup, having won the Warszawa event in Niemann absence earlier on.
But as with other events in Albertville, the competition was adversely affected by the warm weather. Several countries complained about the ice preparation schedule, which left the pairs immediately after ice cleaning with considerably better circumstances than those skaters in later pairs. This was to the benefit of a German outsider, Jacqueline BÃ¶rner. She had been the World Allround Champion in 1990, but later that year she had suffered severe injuries in a car accident. While bike training in Berlin with several teammates, she was hit by a Trabant, after an altercation between the car driver and the skaters. She sustained leg, knee, rib and head injuries, and was still walking with crutches a year before the Olympics. She recovered in time for the Olympic season, but did not have high hopes for the Games. A third place at the Berlin World Cup gave her hope for a bronze medal in Albertville. But her first pair performance of 2:05.87 would land her the gold medal. Duped by the conditions, Hunyady (pair five) did no better than seventh, while Niemann (pair six) finished just 0.05 seconds behind her teammate. The bronze was surprisingly won by Seiko Hashimoto, also a three time Olympian in track cycling. While she had been runner-up behind BÃ¶rner at the 1990 World Championships, she had recently concentrated on sprinting, and her 1,500 m medal was unexpected.

The event was hampered by high winds, which also slowed the men 1,500 and 5,000. The early pace was set in the first pair by Klara Guseva, who finished in 2:28.7. That lasted until the seventh pair, when Polish skater Elwira SeroczyÅska bettered the time by a full three seconds.

The defending champion and 2018 and 2019 World Champion Choi Min-Jeong was also a serious title contender, having already won silver in the 1,000 m.
Despite some issues with the timing and lap counter controls, the quarter-finals went as expected. The semi-finals were mostly the same, with Lee and Fontana eliminating Kim Boutin, bronze medalist in the 500 m, in the first heat. Schulting and Hanne Desmet dominated the second semi-final, while Choi bettered the Olympic record in the final heat, with Han Yutong and Xandra Velzeboer tagging along.
Han attempted to pull away from the field early in the final, with Schulting quickly catching up. The two did not press, and the rest of the field reconnected, with Choi now taking charge. At three laps to go, Schulting attempted to pass Han, but was pushed to the outside, dropping her back behind Fontana. Schulting quickly passed Han on the next opportunity, but with the high pace set by Choi, there were no further options for passing.
This made Choi the third 2018 female short-track skater to retain her 2018 title, after Fontana (500 m) and Schulting (1,000 m), and with all three of them ending up on the podium.

Friesinger, the defending Olympic Champion, had won the world title in 2001, 2003 and 2004 and was runner-up in 2005. She had also taken the 1500 m World Cup in 2003. Klassen had taken the World Cup in 2004 and 2005, also winning the 2005 World Championships. In 2005, the women had been exchanging the World Record set by Friesinger during her Olympic victory in 2002. First bettered by Klassen in January, she again lowered it in October, only to be beaten by Friesinger a week later. At the World Cup in Salt Lake City, Klassen then took it back, setting a staggering 1:51.79.
Interestingly, the two top contenders were drawn in the same pair. At the time they took to the ice, the leading time had been set by Kristina Groves of Canada, 1:56.74, better than Friesinger pre-Games rink record. Klassen took off with an insane pace, leaving Friesinger well behind. She managed to come back a little in the first full lap, but this effort cost her too much, and she had to let Klassen go. The Canadian finished almost 11/2 seconds ahead of the leading time with 1:55.27, while beating Friesinger by a full two seconds. In the final pair, 3000 m winner Ireen WÃ¼st managed to edge ahead of Friesinger for a bronze medal, leaving Klassen and Groves a 1-2 Canadian victory.

1091,"1,500 metres, Women",1994 Winter Olympics,45,Speed Skating,21 February 1994,"Olympiahall, Hamar",30 from 11 countries,na,na,"Prior to the Games, just one woman was expected to win the title in the 1,500 m: Gunda Niemann. The German had dominated women allround skating, winning the 1991, 1992 and 1993 World Allround Championships and the 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992 and 1994 European Championships. She had won the 1,500 m at most of these competitions, though not at the 1994 Europeans, which were held on the Olympic ice. She had, however, won all World Cup races in the event during the season, and sported a silver medal from Albertville 1992. The women who had beaten her earlier in Hamar was Emese Hunyady, a native Hungarian who had married an Austrian man to escape her communist home country. With Niemann confidence damaged after her fall in the Olympic 3,000 m, Hunyady hoped to repeat that win at the Olympics.
Niemann skated in the first pair against the winner of the 3,000 m, Svetlana Bazhanova. She beat the Russian woman this time, but her final time of 2:03.41 was a second slower than she had been at the same rink in January, and 1.6 seconds slower than she had been at the December World Cup. That this time was beatable was quickly proven by Bonnie Blair, already winner of the 500 m. Not known for her 1,500 ms, she approached Niemann leading time by 0.03 seconds. Then it was Hunyady turn. The former figure skater started out with a 4-tenths advantage, and then slowly expanded her lead to win in 2:02.19. That time would remain unbeaten for the rest of the competition, earning Austria its first Olympic title in speed skating. For Niemann, matters became worse when another skater also beat her time. Gynecology student Svetlana Fedotkina was considered an outsider for a medal, and delivered on that promise. With a very fast start, she built up a half-second gap to Hunyady at the bell. She lost a full second in that last lap, but her 2:02.69 was enough for silver. Later, her Olympic performance became somewhat tainted: in January 1996 she was caught for doping use and suspended for two years.

Most notably, it featured the winner of the 1,000 m, Christine Nesbitt and Kristina Groves, who had won the event at the 2009 World Championships only to be disqualified for touching the lane divider with her skate. The other two team members were Brittany Schussler, who had been on the podium at the Berlin World Cup, and the star of the 2006 Games, Cindy Klassen, who had been injured in 2009 and appeared to be past her prime. With the 2008 and 2009 World Champion, Anni Friesinger-Postma out of shape due to an early-season injury, the biggest threat to the Canadians were 2007 World Champion Ireen WÃ¼st (NED) and Martina SÃ¡blÃ­kovÃ¡ (CZE), who had recently expanded her domain from the long distances to the 1,500 m.
Friesinger rink record of 1:58.66 was first broken by Annette Gerritsen, followed by Nao Kodaira and Margot Boer, the latter setting it to 1:58.10. Then it was Ireen WÃ¼st turn, the 3,000 m champion of the Torino Games. She had seen some poor results in the past seasons, WÃ¼st had recorded many good results in sprint, all-round and distance competitions. She had won the World Cup race in Heerenveen earlier in the season, and again displayed that form in Richmond. Starting out all-or-nothing as always, she held on to record 1:56.89. Quite the opposite skater, Martina SÃ¡blÃ­kovÃ¡ raced next, but even her formidable final lap couldnât make up for her 1.74-second loss in the first part of the race. She did move into second place with 1:57.96, though.
Next up were the Canadians. Groves took off even faster than WÃ¼st, and she enjoyed a half-second lead at the bell. But Groves had to pay for her fast start in the final 400 m, dropping behind WÃ¼st with 1:57.14. In the last pair, Nesbitt followed much the same pattern as Groves. She held the same pace as the Dutchwoman until 1,100 m, but losing contact in the final lap. Nesbitt even dropped out of the medals, leaving WÃ¼st to win ahead of Groves and SÃ¡blÃ­kova.

East Germany Karin Kessow had won the 1975 World Championships and won the distance at that tournament. Tatyana Averina had set the last two world records in the 1,500, the current one her 2:09.90, set at Medeo in 1975, which shattered the previous record by 4.1 seconds. And although Sheila Young was a better sprinter, she was solid at this distance as well, and needed to be watched. The opening pair saw Norway Lisbeth Korsmo break the Olympic record with a time of 2:18.99. That held up until Averina finished the fourth pairing in 2:17.96. The seventh pair had Averina teammate Galina Stepanskaya, who had won the distance at the 1973 World Championships, but whose performances since had been somewhat ordinary. She set a fast pace, over a full second ahead of Averina at the 1,100 split, and held on, crossing in 2:16.58 to move well ahead. Young went off two pairs later, with Kessow, and though she was far behind at 1,100 metres, she had the fastest final lap to finish in 2:17.06 and win the silver medal, behind Stepanskaya, with Averina taking bronze, Korsmo in fourth, and Kessow placing fifth. The surprising Stepanskaya would place second at the World Championships in 1977 and 1978, winning the 1,500 and 3,000 at the 1977 Worlds.

Her best placement in the Olympic season, however, was a sole second place at the Stavanger World Cup. Instead of Bergsma, Japan Miho Takagi - a bronze medalist at the 2017 Worlds - had won the first four races of the World Cup season. The Dutch had claimed the first four spots at the 2014 Games, and they fielded almost the same team. Due to the reduction in quota, only three skaters were allowed to go, and in the competitive Dutch Trials that meant that defending champion Jorien ter Mors did not qualify. That still left the 2010 champion and 2014 silver medallist Ireen WÃ¼st, runner-up in the 2017 World Cup season Marrit Leenstra and 2014 bronze medallist Lotte van Beek.
Sprinter Nao Kodaira set a tough pace in the second pair, putting the target at 1:56.11. The first to contest that mark was Brittany Bowe. The 2015 world champion, she had suffered a concussion in training in 2016 and had required a long path to recovery. Her 1:55.54 took her to first place, albeit with all of the season best skaters still to come. WÃ¼st, winner of the fifth World Cup in 2018, was the first of them. In her characteristic all-or-nothing style, she shattered Bowe mark by a full second (1:54.35). Leenstra mounted a serious attack in the following pair, but lost a full second in the final lap to end up in second with 1:55.26. Van Beek then attacked Leenstra time, and only missed it by 1/100 of a second. With one pair to go, this meant the Dutch were headed for another podium sweep, except that Takagi and Bergsma still had to skate. Bergsma had the second-fastest first half, but had lost her advantage to WÃ¼st at the bell and faded to an 8th place finish. By contrast, Takagi had stuck to WÃ¼st pace, and managed to stay quite close even in the final lap, ending up a close second with 1:54.55.
Next to her title, WÃ¼st earned several records with her win. With 5 golds (10 total), she became the most successful Dutch Olympian of all time. She also became the first Winter Olympian to win gold at four consecutive Games, a record shared with Olympic greats Michael Phelps, Carl Lewis, Al Oerter, Ben Ainslie, Kaori Icho and Paul ElvstrÃ¸m.

Both did post very fast times, well below the official world record of 3:10.4, held by Poland Zofja Nehringowa, but the North American packstyle format used allowed for drafting, thus invalidating the performance as a world record.
The final went to American Kit Klein, with Wilson placing second and Brooks-Potter coming in sixth and last. The bronze medal went to American Helen Bina. At the first unofficial women World Championship in 1933, Bina would finish third in all-around.

There was no clear favorite but the last two World Champions had both won the distance at those tournaments, and Nataliya Petrusyova (1980) and Beth Heiden (1979) were considered to have a slight edge. Heiden started in the first pair, crossing in 2:13.10, an Olympic record and a personal best. But in the third pair, Dutchwoman Ria Visser, the 1979 Dutch all-around champion, finished in 2:12.35 to move into the lead. She skated with Petrusyova, who surprisingly struggled, finishing in 2:14.15. In the fifth pair, Visser teammate Annie Borckink was paired with Soviet 70s star Tatyana Barabash, who was no longer considered a challenger in this event. Borckink had been skating in Dutch meets since 1973 and had three times won the 1,000 at the Dutch Championships, but she had never won a distance at an international meet, and her best all-around finish in an international tournament was eighth at the 1977 World Championships. But she started well, although she was behind Visser time at 1,100 metres, only to finish very strongly, winning a surprising gold medal by 1.4 seconds with a time of 2:10.95. Borckink skated for one more year but never won another international distance race or tournament. Visser would continue to compete thru 1988, winning the Dutch Championships in 1983-85. The 1-2 finish by the Dutch women was a huge upset. Many years later, Visser would comment that the Dutch women were skating so poorly in 1980 that it was being considered not to enter a women team at Lake Placid.

The defending champion from Vancouver, WÃ¼st had won two of the three World Cup races in which she had participated prior to the Olympics, although the 2013-14 season first World Cup had been won by her compatriot Lotte van Beek, who had also won silver behind WÃ¼st at the 2013 World Championships. The third World Cup victor at the start was Brittany Bowe, although she had - along with most of the US team - disappointed in her earlier appearances in Sochi. An outsider in the field was a third Dutchwoman, Jorien ter Mors. Originally a short-track speed skater, she had tried out long track at her coach suggestion. This try-out had turned out successfully, surprisingly winning the Dutch all-round title in 2013. Due to illness, ter Mors had performed below expectations at the Dutch trials, and had only managed to qualify for the 1,500 m.
Ter Mors, not having competed much in the World Cup circuit, was drawn early in the schedule, racing in the last pair before the ice resurfacing break. The Dutch opening ceremony flagbearer demolished WÃ¼st 2013 track record by nearly 2 seconds, arriving in a new Olympic Record of 1:53.51. None of the other skaters would approach that time. WÃ¼st had been distracted by ter Morsâ impressive mark, and could not keep her pace, finishing half a second behind the short track skater. WÃ¼st again was half a second ahead of Van Beek, who completed the third all-Dutch podium at the Sochi Olympics. To complete the Dutch dominance, Marrit Leenstra placed 4th - albeit three seconds behind ter Mors. Although overjoyed with her Olympic gold medal (which was later augmented with a pursuit gold), ter Morsâ Olympics did not fully go as planned, as she failed to medal in her primary sport, placing 4th, 5th and 6th in the individual short-track events.

In the 1997-98 season, her time was finally beaten, by sprinter Catriona Le May Doan, who set a new record of 1:57.87. But normally, the 1500 m was the domain of the German woman, notably Gunda Niemann-Stirnemann, who had won three of the four World Cup races that year, as well as the 1997 World Championships. The remaining World Cup race had been won by defending champion Emese Hunyady of Austria. Other medal hopefuls were Anni Friesinger, Claudia Pechstein and Chris Witty.
Marianne Timmer was at best a medal outsider, despite having won the bronze at the 1997 World Championships as an early clap skate adapter. In the Olympic season, she had not medaled internationally, and was drawn early in the program. Better known as a sprinter, she got off quickly but held on, breaking the world record to her own and everybody surprise: 1:57.58.

Having won 26 World Cups, five world titles and two Olympic golds in the 1,500 m, defending champion WÃ¼st was undeniably one of favorites. Her main challenger was considered to be Japan Miho Takagi, the 2018 silver medalist who had won all three 1,500 m World Cups in the 2021/22 season she contested. The fourth World Cup was won by Brittany Bowe, also the 2015 world champion, while surprise 2021 champion Ragne Wiklund was considered an outsider for the gold.
ROC Yevgeniya Lalenkova, world bronze medalist in 2021, produced the first 1:55 time of the day, with 1:55.74, which was soon improved by Marijke Groenewoud, a surprise qualifier for the Dutch team. In pair 11, that time was narrowly beaten by Antoinette de Jong with 1:54.82. De Jong had beaten WÃ¼st to the European title in January, but WÃ¼st wasnât going to have that happen in Beijing. After opening in 25.51 (same as De Jong), she managed to keep her speed throughout the end, gradually building up a lead of 1.5 seconds and beating the Olympic Record with 1:53.28. That left three Dutch skaters in the lead with three pairs to go.
World Cup leader Ayano Sato matched the splits of De Jong, but crossed the finish line a tenth of a second later, just ahead of Groenwoud. In pair 14, Bowe and Wiklund both disappointed, with Bowe laptimes blowing up after a fast start, and Wiklund just never picking up sufficient speed. That left only Takagi and Yelizaveta Golubeva. The Japanese favorite had the fastest opening of the day but lost to WÃ¼st in both subsequent laps. At the bell, she trailed the Dutchwoman by only 0.03, but her final lap was slightly worse, reaching 1:53.72 at the finish line.

She had placed third in the 500 m, fourth in the 3,000 m and second in the 1,000 m. Not a long distance skater, the 1,500 m seemed her last chance to win a gold medal in Calgary. Her resume for the 1,500 m was outstanding: as the defending Olympic Champion, she had won all four World Cup races of the season. With her miraculous 1:59.30 from 1986, she was also the only woman to have beaten 2 minutes in the distance. She could expect competition from her teammates, notably Andrea Ehrig and 500 m winner Bonnie Blair. After her surprising win in the 3,000 m, Yvonne van Gennip was also considered for a medal.
Ehrig was the first favorite to go, in the second pair. Her race was stable, with a 1-second drop in lap times at every split, and she finished in 2:01.00, just half-a-second away from her personal best, set in the same as the world record. Kania, up next, got off half a second faster than her closest rival, but lost ground in the next two laps, matching Ehrig split at the bell. In her final lap, she recovered noticeably, and finished with 2:00.82, the second best time ever. Next up was Yvonne van Gennip. She held equal pace with Ehrig times, before gaining half a second in the second full lap. She a large part of that advantage in the final 400 ms, but 2:00.68 was enough for first place. When Blair stayed well clear of the top three, it was certain that Van Gennip had delivered a second surprise, and that Kania would not win a fourth Olympic title. Both Ehrig and Kania ended their career after the 1988 season. The two of them had dominated women skating in the 1980s.

In her absence, the gold was conceded to Skoblikova, who had won the 1963 World Championships, and won all four distances on her way to the title. She had already won the 500 in Innsbruck.
In the second pair, Soviet skater Berta Kolokoltseva finished in 2:27.1 to take the lead. That would lead until the seventh pair when Finland Kaija Mustonen finished in 2:25.5. That was somewhat surprising as, prior to 1964, Mustonen had never made the podium at any distance in a major international tournament, although she had finished third in a pre-Olympic test 1,500 on 26 January, behind Skoblikova and Valentina Stenina. Skoblikova started in the 10th pair. She was equal to Kolokoltseva and Mustonen thru 700 metres, but was two seconds ahead at 1,100 metres, and won by almost three seconds, finishing in 2:22.6.

It would only feature on the Olympic Program three times (1992, 1994, 1998) with the 15 km returning in 2002. The event had been held at the 1991 World Championships for the first time, won by Norway Terje Langli, with BjÃ¸rn DÃ¦hlie winning the 15 km.
The event was skied in the classical style as, beginning in 1992, the style for each cross-country race was mandated in advance. The race was skied in difficult conditions as it snowed heavily throughout. DÃ¦hlie was the World Cup leader in the 1991-92 season, but would finish only fourth. Langli would struggle and finish only 20th. But their teammate, Vegard Ulvang, would win the gold medal, his second in Albertville as he had already won the 30 km. Ulvang chose to ski without wax for the first time in his career because of the difficult snow conditions. He then fell shortly after the 5 km check, breaking the handle of a ski pole. But he was given a replacement and was the strongest skier in the race, winning by 16.2 seconds despite that difficulty. Ulvang had been only ninth at the first time check, and fourth at the second, but had the best finish. Marco Albarello won the silver medal narrowly over Sweden Christer MajbÃ¤ck.
Ulvang would win three gold medals in Albertville, also winning the 30 km and relay, and add a silver in the pursuit. MajbÃ¤ck had been the silver medalist in the event at the 1991 World Championships while Albarello had won the 1987 15 km World Championship.

Already with eight Olympic medals and five golds, to describe him as the favorite was an understatement. The race was held in a steady rain, which made conditions difficult for the skiers. But the Norwegian waxers set up five pairs of skis for DÃ¦hlie who tested them shortly before starting and then chose the best pair.
DÃ¦hlie started fast and had the lead at both of the time checks, with Kazakhstan Vladimir Smirnov in second at 6.5 km. Both slowed down in the final kilometers but DÃ¦hlie had done enough to stay ahead, and won the gold medal by eight seconds. The silver medal went to the surprising Austrian Markus Gandler. Gandler had been skiing internationally since the late 1980s but had won little. He started slowly in this race, but had the fastest finishing split from 6.5 km to the line to place second.
This race also saw the appearance of the first black African in cross-country skiing, Philip Boit of Kenya. Boit was last of the 92 finishers, almost eight minutes behind 91st place, Gjoko Dineski of Macedonia. But when he finished, waiting at the line for his arrival was BjÃ¸rn DÃ¦hlie, who embraced him after his finish. After 1998 this race was not held at the 2002 or 2006 Winter Olympics, replaced by the 15 km.

The short-distance race for men had previously been 15 kilometres, or 18 kilometres through 1952, but in 1992 it was changed to 10 km. The event had been won at the last two World Championships by Terje Langli (1991) and Sture Sivertsen (1993) but the favorites in the event were BjÃ¸rn DÃ¦hlie and Vladimir Smirnov. DÃ¦hlie had won the last two seasonal World Cups, and was fighting with Smirnov in the 1993-94 season, which would be won Smirnov, who had also won in 1990-91. Smirnov had also been second in 1992-93 and third in 1991-92. For a short race, DÃ¦hlie won fairly comfortably, with an 18+ second lead over Smirnov, who took the silver medal. Smirnov started slowly, trailing the pace of Marco Albarello but had moved to second at the second checkpoint.
Albarello hung on for the bronze medal. He had won two silvers in Albertville and would add a gold in the relay in Lillehammer. Smirnov was in his third Winter Olympics, representing his third country, after the Soviet Union in 1988 and the Unified Team in 1992, he was now skiing for Kazakhstan. He had won three medals in Calgary, and would do likewise in Lillehammer, winning his only Olympic gold medal in the 50 km, and adding silver in the pursuit. At Nagano he would finish his Olympic career with a bronze in the pursuit. DÃ¦hlie was, well, DÃ¦hlie. He had won four medals and three golds in Albertville, would win four medals and two golds in Lillehammer, and would end his Olympic career with another four golds and three golds in Nagano. His 12 Olympic medals and eight gold medals are both records for the Winter Olympics through 2006.

Danilova led by over 15 seconds at 5.8 km, but Skari-Martinsen had closed to within 10 seconds at 8.7 km. And then she blasted to the finish, defeating Danilova to win by 21/2 seconds, as expected, though it had not been easy.

But that podium didnât last. Skari-Martinsen won the gold medal. But Danilova and Lazutina would eventually be disqualified when it was revealed they had tested positive for darpopoietin, an erythropoietin analogue. This was not revealed, however, until October 2003, for Danilova, and two months later for Lazutina. Chepalova was moved up to the silver medal, while fifth-place finisher Stefania Belmondo was awarded the bronze medal. In 2003 Skari-Martinsen would win the event at the World Championships.

In spite of her love of this event none of her previous four Olympic medals had come in the 10 km classic, and her first appearance in Sochi in the skiathlon had been a major disappointment.
Starting at 30 second intervals, the early leader was Russia Nataliya Zhukova who would eventually finish seventh overall. The first competitor to beat this time was German Stefanie BÃ¶hler, whose eventual sixth place was a major achievement, after a malignant tumor was discovered in her thyroid gland in 2012, which required two operations for removal. Finland Aino-Kaisa Saarinen became the first skier to beat 29 minutes, but this time still did not get her into the medal ranks. Starting as 43rd runner, Kowalczyk dominated the event from the start. She led at the 2.2 km mark and at the 5 km point, increased her advantage to 9.1 sec over Norway Marit BjÃ¸rgen, who had dominated the 10 km together with Kowalczyk for the last four years. BjÃ¸rgen was still on the silver medal rank at the 8 km mark, now 19.1 seconds behind Kowalczyk. But the Norwegian had raced in the sprints and tired badly in the final two kilometres, finishing fifth. Justyna Kowalczyk completed the course 18.4 seconds ahead of Sweden defending Olympic champion Charlotte Kalla, to take the gold. The bronze medal eventually went to Therese Johaug of Norway, the 2013 world champion and World Cup leader.

In a race contested under excellent conditions, with little wind, and bright sunshine, Marit BjÃ¸rgen crossed the finish line as the first of the favorites to set a mark. Then it looked like another triumph for skiathlon gold medalist, Charlotte Kalla but, at the 5 km mark, it became obvious that Haga, who started at a relatively modest pace, could actually outperform the two favorites. She took the lead between km 5 and 6, gradually increasing her lead. PÃ¤rmÃ¤koski was in fifth or sixth place throughout the race, but a strong finish closed the gap to BjÃ¸rgen, equaling her time, and winning the second of her of three medals in PyeongChang.

Formerly the domain of specialist marathon swimmers, the lure of Olympic gold had begun to attract those with a high class background in the 1500 metres. The favoured swimmers soon moved to the front of the pack as Britain David Davies took the lead from an early stage and one by one the rest of the field dropped away until just a trio of swimmers were left in contention. Davies still led with a few hundred metres to go but he drifted away from the finishing funnel and had to cut sharply back onto the right path to the finish. This gave Holland Maarten van der Weijden the opportunity to pull ahead in the race for gold and he was not to waste his change and finished clear of the chasing pair of Davies, who held on for silver, and Germany Thomas Lurz. The reigning World Champion, Vladimir Dyatchin of Russia, had the ignominy of being disqualified for obstructing fellow swimmers.
Van der Weijden victory was amongst the most emotional triumphs of the entire 2008 Games as his promising career has seemingly ended in 2001 when he was diagnosed with leukemia. With the aid of stem cell treatment he had returned after a two-year absence to resume his swimming career. Van der Weijden had won bronze at the 2006 European Championships in the 10K. At the 2008 World Championships in open water swimming, he won the gold medal in the 25 km.

A lead pack of seven swimmers, including Anderson, Cunha, and van Rouwendaal, separated themselves from the field. Also in contention were Germany Leonie Beck, who was transitioning from pool distance swimming, and Australia Kareena Lee, who was a bit of an unknown.
Cunha was always at or near the lead, which saw the United Statesâ Ashley Twichell ahead at many of the early checkpoints. At the last split, Cunha led followed by van Rouwendaal with Beck third and Lee fourth, as Twichell and Anderson dropped back over the final legs.
Cunha held on for the gold medal ahead of van Rouwendaal, as Lee finished the strongest to come on for the bronze medal, with Hungary Anna Olasz finishing fourth and Beck fifth.

Lara Ilchenko of Russia had won five successive world titles at 5 km and the last three over 10 km. The pattern of the race emerged at an early stage with the British pair of Cassie Patten and Keri-Anne Payne moving to the front of the pack and forcing the pace. The tactic worked to the point that only two others were able to follow. Ilchenko stayed on the shoulders of the leaders before unleashing her sprint with 110 metres to go. She sped clear to finish ahead of Payne with Patten edging Angela Maurer of Germany for the bronze medal. Natalie du Toit of South Africa finished in 16th position. Du Toit had represented her nation at the age of 14 but lost a leg in a motorcycle accident in 2001. She came to world attention by winning five titles at the 2004 Paralympic Games then in 2008 qualified for the Olympic Games by placing 4th at the World Championships.

The leader in that event starts off, and then every skier after him would start behind by the time margin from the sprint. Only the top 60 finishers from the sprint were eligible to start, but in reality, many of the lower finishers would elect not to start this race. For the women, only 52 eventually started in Salt Lake City. The pursuit had been contested at the World Championships since 1997.
Geman Kati Wilhelm had won the sprint and started first, 16 seconds ahead of her teammate Uschi Disl. Disl would fold, done in by seven missed targets, and eventually placed ninth. Olga Pyleva had been only eighth in the sprint, and started 1:03 behind Wilhelm. But she missed only one target in the pursuit section, and with Wilhelm missing four, including three of her first five, Pyleva powered ahead to finish 5.3 seconds ahead of Wilhelm for the gold medal.

Pyleva was not unknown, having won gold medals at the 2000 and 2001 World Championships in the relay. This was her first international gold medal, although she would later win the 15 km individual at the 2004 World Championships. At the 2006 Winter Olympics she initially finished second in the 15 km, but was later disqualified for doping when her urine sample revealed traces of the banned stimulant, carphedon, which is purported to increase endurance and tolerance to cold.

The contest for third place was just as interesting, with Marie Dorin of France who started in that position, fading to finish 17th.

It was the largest margin of victory in any women Olympic biathlon event. Starting with a lead of 32.4 seconds after the sprint, she increased the margin to almost two minutes after the last shooting, easily maintaining her advantage on the last loop. After three mistakes, Ãberg needed a clean shoot, and fast final loop, to improve on her sixth place, which she did to take silver from Tiril Eckhoff.
Behind them, an intense battle for bronze broke out on the final lap, and Eckhoff finally secured the bronze medal with a furious final sprint, putting two Norwegians on the podium. Still seventh after the last shooting, she overtook Dorothea Wierer (Italy), Hanna Sola (Belarus), and Lisa Theresa Hauser (Austria) to capture the bronze.
Ingrid Landmark Tandrevold had the best prospects, leaving the range after the fourth shooting in third place.

She lost more than one and a half minutes to Eckhoff, the fastest skier on the final loop. Luckily, the Norwegian team doctor gave Tandrevold the all-clear a little later, but she still cancelled her starts in the relay and mass start.

On the second leg, East Germany Axel Lesser immediately took the lead, and now the gold medal team from the 1974 World Championships had taken over as favorites for an Olympic gold. But alas, the drama continued.

The United States could not hold their medal position and dropped down to sixth place, but the Soviet Union Ivan Garanin was able to pass Switzerland and Sweden in the final stages and secure a bronze medal for the unlucky Soviet team. The team had used a new type of ski binding, apparently not strong enough for the pace and rhythm changes in a fast 10 km relay leg.

Albarello faced Norway Vegard Ulvang, a Norwegian ski hero, but one who was struggling in Lillehammer, as it came a few months after the death of his brother in a ski accident. Ulvang, who had missed weeks of training searching for his lost brother, could not match the Italian and at the second exchange, Italy led, with Norway second and Finland third, although only 1.1 seconds separated the leaders. The medals were decided as Russia was in fourth, almost 11/2 minutes behind.
The third leg skiers were Thomas Alsgaard for Norway, already winner of the 30 km, Giorgio Vanzetta for Italy, and Jari RÃ¤sÃ¤nen for Finland. RÃ¤sÃ¤nen hadnât been told that the race was supposed to be between Norway and Italy, as he skied the fastest third leg and put Finland into the lead at the anchor exchange. Italy was second and Norway third, but again, only 1.1 seconds separated the three teams. On the final leg Finland would drop back, unable to keep pace with BjÃ¸rn DÃ¦hlie for Norway and Silvio Fauner for Italy. Fauner skied on DÃ¦hlie back throughout most of the 10 km leg, refusing to take the lead, even when DÃ¦hlie almost stopped, trying to force Fauner to go ahead, in accord with skiing traditions. But Fauner refused to set the pace, leading Alsgaard to later comment, âWe hate them for that.â On the final turn into Birkerbeineren Stadium, Fauner moved just ahead of DÃ¦hlie. The 150,000 Norwegians were screaming, and cowbells were ablazing, but as DÃ¦hlie made his move 100 metres from the line, Fauner matched it and Italy won by 4/10ths of a second in the greatest ever ski race.
It is said that the Italians celebrated for two months over their victory, while all Norway mourned. In 1998, Norway and Italy would go at it again, this time Norway winning by an even closer margin, 2/10ths of a second. In 2002, the result was the same â Norway 1, Italy 2 â with the margin still only 3/10ths of a second. Over three Winter Olympics, the two teams would race 120 kilometres, with the total winning margin less than a second, and Norway ahead in cumulative time by 0.1 seconds. But they had lost the one they really wanted, on their home snow, in their hallowed ski stadium, and it would always hurt. It has been called âThe Great Race,â and if you mention just that to a Nordic skiing fan, preferably not a Norwegian, they will know what you mean.

The three teams were expected to again battle for the medals, as the finish at the 1995 and 1997 World Championships had been Norway, Finland, and Italy, in that order. The opening leg in Nagano was a surprise with Germany leading, and Norway in 10th place, as Erling Jevne hit the wall at eight kilometers. Finland was third and Italy fourth, but fortunately for Norway, the margin was less than 20 seconds to Finland. On the second leg Sture Sivertsen pulled Norway up to second, though still trailing Italy and Fulvio Valbusa by 12 seconds. Norway sent out ski legend BjÃ¸rn DÃ¦hlie on the third leg, and he made up ground on Fabio Maj. At the final exchange, Italy led by 0.5 seconds, with Finland in third, though now a full minute behind.
As in Lillehammer the anchor leg battle between Norway and Italy was the stuff of high drama. Thomas Alsgaard was the Norwegian anchor, facing Italy Silvio Fauner. As the Italians had done four years before, Alsgaard sat on Fauner tail for most of the leg, refusing to take the lead. Then in the stadium he unleashed a sprint 150 metres from the line, to win the gold medal for his team by 2/10ths of a second. Four years later in Salt Lake City, Norway and Italy would again battle to the line, Norway again winning, this time by 3/10ths of a second. In three relay races, over eight years, and 120 kilometres, Norway and Italy would battle to a near skiing death, the cumulative winning margins less than a full second, and Norway leading on total time by 0.1 seconds.
Finland did hang on for the bronze medal, but they were closely challenged by Sweden, which was less than 10 seconds away from the podium. For BjÃ¸rn DÃ¦hlie this was his seventh gold medal, a Winter Olympic record.

However they had strong competition from the Scandinavian countries. Swedenâ Lars Nelson led marginally over Finland at the end of the first leg with France close behind, while Russia was far behind in eighth place. Sweden Daniel Richardsson and Finland Iivo Niskanen came to the second exchange almost simultaneously, while a strong leg by LukÃ¡Å¡ Bauer brought the Czech team within 17 sec of the leaders.
Johan Olsson skied the third leg for Sweden and was the team top performer, soon pulling away from Lari Lehtonen, who was also overtaken by Aleksandr Legkov, making a major effort for the Russian team. His time was 27 seconds faster than Olsson and brought Russia to second place only 14 sec behind the leaders. 
On the final leg, Marcus Hellner was able to ski comfortably to victory for Sweden. Ivan Perrillat Boiteux briefly brought the French team level with the Russians, but Maksim Vylegzhanin secured second place for Russia 4.6 seconds ahead of the French team â a major upset which brought the country its 100th medal in Olympic Winter Games. As in the ladiesâ relay Norway was the favorite, but again failed to medal, placing fourth.
By winning the 4x10 km relay Sweden successfully defended the title with three members of the team â  Richardsson, Olsson and Hellner â from their victorious Vancouver squad in 2010. Moreover, Sweden became the first country in 42 years to win both the men and women relay events at one Olympic Winter Games.
In May 2016 WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) commissioned a report, the McLaren Report, to look into allegations of systematic Russian doping and a cover-up to avoid positives at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. The report was released in two parts, in July and December 2016, and confirmed the allegations. In 2017 the IOC formed a commission to investigate this, headed by IOC Member Denis Oswald, and usually referred to as the Oswald Commission. In late October 2017 the Oswald Commission began to release its findings.
One of the first findings was to implicate Aleksandr Legkov, one of the Russian skiiers in this event. Legkov was disqualified, as was the Russian relay team, and their silver medal effectively removed. Eight days later, on 9 November, Maksim Vylegzhanin, another Russian skiier, was also disqualified, followed shortly thereafter by the disqualification of Aleksandr Bessmertnykh. Legkov and Vylegzhanin immediately appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). About 10 days before the PyeongChang Winter Olympics began, the CAS reached a decision and both Legkov and Vylegzhanin were exonerated and the Russian relay medal was restored.

However, in view of their previous performances in PyeongChang, Norway and the young Olympic Athletes from Russia were considered as favorites ahead of the Swedes. Since the introduction of two different styles in cross-country skiing, the relay consists of two legs in the classical style, and two in the freestyle. After the first 3.3 km lap, Kazakhstan best skier Aleksey Poltoranin increased the pace and dominated the field of 14 teams, closely followed by the Russian Andrey Larkov. To the first exchange, the third and fourth teams, Italy and France, came about ten seconds back and favorites Norway with Didrik TÃ¸nseth 18 seconds behind. In the third lap, Sweden Jens Burman started to lose contact and came to the first exchange 37 seconds behind the leader Poltoranin.
Aleksandr Bolshunov, the second skier for the OAR, quickly pulled away from the chasing group consisting of Italy, France and Norway veteran Martin Johnsrud Sundby. Sundby held back letting Maurice Manificat do most of the leader work. Due to the lack of co-operation in the chasing group, Bolshunov managed to extend his lead to 40 seconds at one stage before ending the second exchange nearly 25 seconds ahead of Italy Francesco De Fabiani, 28 seconds ahead of France, with Norway a further four seconds adrift, handing over to the third skier, the first freestyle skater. With almost two minutes behind at the half-way mark, Sweden had virtually given up on the battle for a medal.
On the third leg, skiathlon gold medalist Simen Hegstad KrÃ¼ger took control and clocked the fastest time of the leg, almost 50 seconds faster than Aleksey Chervotkin for the Olympic Athletes from Russia. Led by KrÃ¼ger, the chasing group closed in on Chervotkin on the second round of the leg, outrunning him on the climb from the stadium. The top three teams at the third exchange were Norway and France within one second of each other, and the OAR 16 seconds behind. While Frenchman ClÃ©ment Parisse lost less than 5 seconds to the Norwegian front-runner, Italy Giandomenico Salvadori could not hold on to the top group and lost 1:20 min, slipping from second to fifth.
The fourth and final leg was determined by the tactics of Norway final skier Johannes HÃ¸sflot KlÃ¦bo. Already having won one gold in PyeongChang in the individual sprint, he started with a leisurely pace so that Adrien Backscheider from France had to take the lead allowing Denis Spitsov to close the gap again for the Olympic Athletes from Russia. Spitsov even took the lead, when the runners passed the stadium for the last time. With the now faster pace, Backscheider lost contact but eventually secured the bronze medal for France. On a small downhill stretch, KlÃ¦bo made one of his famous kick-starts and stormed to Norway first men relay gold since 2002 carrying the Norwegian flag over the finish line. Short distance specialist and double medalist in PyeongChang, Denis Spitsov, had to settle for silver, approximately 10 seconds behind, in what was a great success for the team of youngsters. The bronze medal for France was certainly based on their strength as a team. Finland came from behind and finished fourth, ahead of the disappointed Swedish team, and Germany. The Finns had to replace Ristomatti Hakola, sixth in the sprint, by Perttu Hyvarinen, who lost almost a minute on the first leg. Their last runner, Lari Lehtonen could not do anything more than keep Sweden and Germany at bay.
Like Sweden four years earlier in Sochi, Norway won both the women and men relays in PyeongChang. KlÃ¦bo would later also win gold in the team sprint, finishing with three gold medals in PyeongChang.

The Soviet team was the defending Olympic champions, but the Swedish team had beaten the Soviets in the World Championships in 1958, and both Finland and Norway also had medal aspirations.
On the first leg, Sweden Lars Olsson  took the lead, seven seconds ahead of Finland Toimi Alatalo with Norway Harald Gronningen close behind. The opening man for the Soviet team, Anatoly Shelyukin, ran into trouble in the thin air and was a distant eight at the exchange, 2:21 behind the leader. On the second leg, Norway Hallgeir Brenden and Finland 22-year-old Eero MÃ¤ntyranta come together at the exchange. Sweden Janne Stefansson also got into trouble, and Sweden had dropped to sixth place at the exchange, passed also by the Soviets. JÃ³zef Rysula, at only 20-years-old, had brought Poland into third place, closely followed by Italy. In the third leg, Norway Einar Ãstby left Finlands VainÃ¶ Huhtala behind, and gave the Olympic 15 km champion HÃ¥kon Brusveen a 20 second lead ahead of Veikko Hakulinen. The Soviet Union Aleksey Kuznetsov  had brought Soviet up to third position, but they were 2:21 behind the leader and out of contention for the gold medal. Hakulinen caught Brusveen halfway on the last leg and had a 30 m lead, but the energetic Brusveen was able to close the gap and the two rivals entered the ski stadium in McKinney Creek side-by-side. In a close finish, Hakulinen won by a couple of meters. Nikolay Anikin, the Soviet anchor leg skier, secured the bronze medal ahead of fast finishing Sixten Jernberg. It was Jernberg seventh Olympic start, and for the first time he was outside a medal position.

But by the end of the second leg, Sweden and the Soviet Union had established themselves as the class of the race, almost in a tie for the lead, with Czechoslovakia another 30 seconds back. But Gunde Svan skied the third leg for Sweden, and he opened up a 27-second lead on Mikhail Devyatyarov, who had fallen while trying to chase Svan. The lead was safe and Torgny Mogren secured the gold medal for Sweden, although Aleksey Prokurorov close the gap to 12.7 seconds, although he had also fallen late in his leg.

The start began in brutally cold conditions â 18Â° C. (-1Â° F.). Fyodor Terentyev, seemingly fully recovered after the 50 km race only two days before, skiied one of the most impressive first legs in Olympic history, and had more than a 11/2 minute lead over Finland August Kiuru at the first exchange. Norway HÃ¥kon Brusveen was in third place, 13 seconds behind Finland. Austria was in a surprising fourth place, but their team dropped down to a final 11th place during the three remaining legs. Italy Pompeo Fattor gave hopes to the home crowd, coming in fifth, three seconds ahead of Sweden Lennart âLill-JÃ¤rvenâ Larsson. On the second leg, Pavel Kolchin widened the gap to their closest rival Finland to a decisive 2:46, and even if the Soviet skiers on the third and fourth leg, Nikolay Anikin and especially Vladimir Kuzin, had some trouble, the Soviet team won with a 1:01 margin over Finland, with Sweden another 1:10 behind, taking the bronze medal.
For Norway, favored for a medal, the second leg turned out to be a catastrophe. Per Olsen, a 23-year-old skier from the northernmost county in Norway and not used to the bright alpine sunshine, was snow-blinded and posted only the eighth best time for the leg, over 31/2 minutes behind the Soviet runner, dropping Norway to fifth place, 5:24 behind the Soviets. Norway double Olympic champion Hallgeir Brenden overtook Italy Federico De Florian on the final leg and brought Norway in to a distant and disappointing fourth place, almost five minutes behind the winning Soviets. The Soviet relay medal was the first at the Olympics not won by a team from Finland, Sweden, or Norway.

Italy Giorgio Di Centa fell back on the second leg, dropping his team to fourth, with Norway still leading, by 11 seconds over Germany.

A group of five nations, Finland, France, Sweden, Germany and Norway took over early in the first leg. Johan Olsson (SWE) and Vincent Vittoz (FRA) then pulled away from the others over the second leg, but an outstanding second leg from LukaÅ¡ Bauer (CZE), bronze medallist in the 15 km, ensured that the three nations started the third leg ahead of the rest, while Norway was back in sixth after two legs.

In SollefteÃ¥, Sweden 1934, Finland won, but Artur HÃ¤ggblad (Sweden) and OddbjÃ¸rn Hagen (Norway) on the anchor leg went off course and lost 10 minutes, allowing Germany to take the silver. In 1935 Finland won again in a tough fight against Norway.
The relay was the first Nordic skiing event in the 1936 Games. Sixteen teams were entered, far more than in the World Championships 1933-1935. Finland had two of their world champions from 1935 on their team, Sulo Nurmela and Klaes Karppinen, anchorman from 1935.  Nurmela was now selected for the first leg. Norway had an almost identical team as the silver lineup from 1935, the only difference being that Trygve Brodahl was replaced by his younger brother, Sverre.  The Norwegians also put their anchorman from 1935, Hagen, on the opening leg.
The cross-country relay developed into one of the most thrilling events of the Games. On the first leg Hagen, skiing for Norway, pulled away from Nurmela and Sweden John Berger when they both fell, and had a one minute lead on Finland and Sweden at the exchange.  On the second leg, Olaf Hoffsbakken increased Norway lead to 1:23. Erik Larsson was able to catch Karppinen and brought Sweden into silver position, closely followed by Finland. On the third leg Brodahl passed the relay over to Bjarne Iversen with a 1:22 lead ahead of Finland, with Sweden almost another minute back, seemingly out of contention for the gold. On Finland anchor leg Kalle Jalkanen had noticed that Iversen, the less merited skier on the Norwegian team, was a good technician on the easier part of the course, but his weak point was obviously uphill. The first half of the course was mostly uphill, and Jalkanen decided to give all he had from the start. His tactics succeeded. He caught the nervous Iversen halfway, they stayed together for another 2-3 km., and then Jalkanen made his final move and was able to leave Iversen 30 m. behind. The winning margin for Finland was 6 seconds.
Jalkanen was the hero of the day with the fastest leg time of all participants. Two years later he was celebrated as world champion over 50 km. on his home ground in Lahti, but on September 5th 1941 he was killed in action on the Kareleian Isthmus in the Continuation War against Soviet Union.

The Soviet anchor leg skier Vyacheslav Vedenin started strongly, and after 5 km he had reduced the gap to the Norwegian Johs Harviken to around half a minute.

Matti PitkÃ¤nen, who had the unfortunate fate of coming fourth in all the individual races at the 1978 World Championships, had brought Finland up to fifth, 41 seconds behind the bronze position, and Sweden had dropped down to sixth, 11 seconds behind their Nordic neighbors. On the last leg, Nikolay Zimyatov easily led the Soviet team to another gold medal, 1:42 ahead of Norway Oddvar BrÃ¥. The fight for the bronze medal was much closer. Finland Juha Mieto went immediately away from his rival in the 15 km race, Thomas Wassberg, and soon overtook Italy, passing West Germany young Jochen Behle in the final stage of his anchor leg, and securing the bronze medal for Finland. Wassberg passed Italy midway on his anchor leg and brought reigning World Champion Sweden into a disappointing fifth place in the final standings.

In the first leg, Soviet Union Ivan Utrobin started extremely fast, after 6 km he had a lead by around one minute, but then he faded badly. Finland VÃ¤inÃ¶ Huhtala caught Utrobin just before the exchange  and finished with a six seconds lead with Norway Magnar Lundemo in third position another six seconds back. Sweden and Italy were still in contention in fourth and fifth position.
On the second leg, Finland Arto Tiainen was struggeling and overtaken by four other teams. At the exchange Soviet Union Gennady Vaganov had the lead, 12 seconds ahead of Norway. The fastest man on the second leg was Italy Marcello De Dorigo who brought his team into third position, gaining 21 seconds on the leading Soviet team. Sweden Sixten Jernberg could not hold off the Italian, but passed Finland  and was still in fourth place, 10 seconds behind Italy.
On the third leg Igor Voronchikhin was able to hold off Norway Einar Ãstby, who was 12 seconds behind at the exchange. Italy dropped down to fifth position almost two minutes behind the leading team, but Finland and Sweden was still fighting for the gold. Finland Kalevi Lauria had the fastest leg time and caught the Swede Janne Stefansson at the exchange, both teams 32 seconds behind Soviet Union.
The anchor leg developed into a very close battle between Sweden Assar RÃ¶nnlund and the double Olympic Champion Eero MÃ¤ntyranta. They soon passed Norway Harald GrÃ¸nningen and one kilometer from home they caught the leading Soviet team. Pavel Kolchin was not able to follow, and in the final stages RÃ¶nnlund went away from MÃ¤ntyranta. Sweden won, eight seconds ahead of Finland, with the Soviet Union another four seconds back. Norway finished fourth, over two minutes ahead of Italy. It was a great victory for Sweden, and Sixten Jernberg ended his great Olympic career with his fourth gold medal and a total of nine Olympic medals.

The 35 year old Norwegian had shown excellent early season form, 2 wins and a second place from 4 World Cup sprint races, and expectations were high that he could add to his tally of nine Olympic medals.
Just as in the women sprint event a day earlier, this race too produced a major surprise. Competitors started at 30 second intervals, and this proved to benefit those with an early start. Klemen Bauer of Slovenia started second and was the early leader in a time of 24:25.2 â this would eventually be good enough for 4th place. Croatian Jakov Fak took over the lead with a time of 24:21.8, but this was soon surpassed by Vincent Jay of France in a time of 24:07.8. As the weather conditions then deteriorated out on the course, the favourites struggled with their shooting in the wind and driving snow. BjÃ¸rndalen chances ended when he missed three shots at his first visit to the range and he had to be content with 17th place. Only his compatriot, Emil Hegle Svendsen mastered the conditions to finish with the silver medal in a time of 24:20.0, although he too started early (10th) and missed one shot on the course. A clear indication that the competition became somewhat of a lottery is the fact that only two of the first fifteen starters placed lower than fifteenth at the finish.
Of the three medallists only Emil Hegle Svendsen appearance on the podium could have been predicted with any confidence. Vincent Jay had been a solid performer on the World Cup circuit but had previously won only a single race, at the pre-Olympic test event at Whistler in March 2010, and had only one top ten finish in the season prior to the Olympics. Jakov Fak was ranked just outside the world top sixty although even this high a ranking was largely gained by a single astonishing performance at the 2009 World Championship where he also won a completely unexpected bronze medal.
This was Croatia first ever Winter Games medal although by summer Fak had already transferred his allegiance to Slovenia.

At the halfway point her teammate Galina Kulakova had an 8-second lead over Olyunina, with the Finnish veteran of 34 years, Marjatta Kajosmaa another 3.5 seconds behind. Norway Aslaug Dahl, a 22-year-old skier from the Sami municipality of Nesseby in the far northeastern part of Norway, was close behind Kajosmaa. The third Soviet skier, Lyubov Mukhachova, was also involved in the medal fight, reaching the halfway point only half a second behind Dahl.
In the last part of the race Kulakova increased her lead and won by a clear margin, over 36 seconds. The fight for the other medals was very close. Olyunina could barely hold her second position, and Kajosmaa was able to split the three Soviet ladies, winning the bronze medal 2 seconds behind Olyunina and 2 seconds ahead of Mukhachova.

In fact, women cross-country skiing had not yet been held at the FIS World Championships program. The host nation Norway was the only nation voting against the proposal to include the event for the Oslo Games. Finland was considered to be the leading nation in the absence of the Soviet Union, as they had already organized national championships for several years. Their best female skier, Tyyne Wideman, national champion in 1949, 1950 and 1951, decided to end her career after the 1951 season. Her twin sister Lydia Wideman, Finnish champion 1952 and newly engaged, had to be strongly persuaded to travel to the Oslo games.

The reigning World Champion at the distance, Zinaida Amosova, was not present, however, failing to qualify for the Soviet Olympic team.

Kulakova was the first of the favorites to finish, but Takalo, starting half a minute behind, immediately took over the lead, finishing 13 seconds ahead of the Soviet veteran. Then everybody eyes were on the 24-year old leader Petzold. She finished 14 seconds stronger than Takalo, and Riihivuori, chasing Petzold from behind, arriving 3.5 seconds too late to beat the leading German woman.

To everybody surprise she faded in the last part of the race and dropped down to fourth, outside the medal podium, 9 seconds behind Takalo.
Even if Petzold victory was a minor surprise, she had earlier shown great promise on the cross-country track.

He had also won the double at the 2013 and 2015 World Championships and in 2011, won the 5,000 metres at World, with a 10K silver. He came to Rio a heavy favorite in both races, and had not been beaten at a major international in five years.
The race was run as a final only, with no heats, as has become standard for the 10K. The early lead was taken by Kenyan Paul Tanui. At 4,000 metres Farah was running alongside American training partner Galen Rupp when Rupp clipped Farah foot and the Brit fell to the track. Farah was up quickly and Rupp slowed to pace him back to the lead pack, reminiscent of a cycling peleton move, and the 1972 Olympic final, when Lasse VirÃ©n had fallen mid-race on his way to the gold medal, and a world record.
With one kilometer left, there was a lead pack of six runners, including Farah, Tanui, and Rupp, when Farah went to the front and ran a 62.4 lap, stringing out the field, and dropping his training partner. Tanui took the lead at the bell, and led by two full metres at 200, but Farah had the speed to chase him down, running his final 100 in 13.4, and his last 800 in 1:56.6. One week later, Farah would win the 5,000 metres again, completing the double-double, previously accomplished only by VirÃ©n.

Before the men 10,000 m, this was said of Sven Kramer. And during the race, Kramer did defeat himself.
Sven Kramer had been absolutely dominant in men speed skating since the 2006 Olympics. He had won nine distance world titles (winning the 5,000, 10,000 and team pursuit three times each), three World Allround titles, three European Allround titles and two long distance World Cups. Since 10 March 2007, the 10,000 m world record was in his hands, as well as five more of the 10 fastest times ever in the event. Dutch speed skating fans, always present in big numbers at major events, had already pre-filled Kramer name as the gold medalist.
When Kramer went to the start in the final pair, the fastest time had been set by Lee Seung-Hun. The Korean, who had already surprised with a silver in the 5,000 m, had finished in 12:58.55, slightly faster than the Olympic Record from 2002. This performance was quite remarkable, considering the fact that Lee had only twice before skated a 10,000 m, and he had beaten his personal best by some 25 seconds. Behind Lee, Ivan Skobrev of Russia and defending champion Bob de Jong held the other medal positions.
As expected, Kramer skated well under Lee pace, and seemed headed for his second gold medal. But after 6,600 m, Kramer coach Gerard Kemkers feared Kramer would be entering the wrong lane after the cross-over (skater have to change lanes each lap), and shouted for him to switch lanes. Kramer only just managed to do this, but Kemkers had been wrong, and he had directed his pupil into the wrong lane. While already fearing disqualification, Kramer still finished the race, in 12:54.50. But he was of course disqualified, and Kramer âcertain goldâ went to Lee.
Kramer was initially very angry with his coach mistake, and speculation arose that the two - working together since the start of Kramer senior career - might separate, but the two quickly discussed matters and looked forward to the team pursuit. Back home in the Netherlands, the disqualification became the tragi-comic highlight of the Winter Olympics, receiving more attention than the gold medals won by Dutch athletes in Vancouver.

His best time in 1968 was 15 seconds faster than the second best time for the year. But the 1968 Olympics were held at the altitude of Ciudad de MÃ©xico, and Clarke had been born and trained at sea-level. The pace was slow, because of the altitude, with 5K passed in 15:00.6, slower than the 1924 final. Mexico Juan MartÃ­nez took the lead on the 19th lap, delighting the home crowd. With two laps remaining the lead pack of four was Clarke, Kenya Naftali Temu, 1966 Commonwealth Games champion, Ethiopia Mamo Wolde, and Tunisia Mohamad Gammoudi, silver medalist from 1964. Temu and Wolde pulled ahead on the penultimate lap, dropping Gammoudi and Clarke. Wolde shot into the lead at the bell but Temu fought back and caught Wolde on the final straight to win by four metres. Clarke struggled in the last two laps, a victim of the altitude, finishing sixth. He collapsed at the finish line, and was administered to by an Australian doctor who was seen crying at the condition of this great athlete.
Ron Clarke is likely the greatest distance runner never to have won a major international championship, winning a bronze medal in the 1964 Olympic 10K, and four silver medals at the Commonwealth Games. But his world records set new standards and confirmed his greatness. In 1968, he visited Czech distance legend Emil ZÃ¡topek at his home in Praha. When ZÃ¡topek took him to the airport, he pressed a gift into Clarke hands, telling him âYou deserve this.â On the plane, Clarke opened it and it was the gold medal ZÃ¡topek had won for the 1952 10,000 metres. Wallechinsky wrote that Clarke had commented, âI do know no one cherishes any gift more than I do, my only Olympic gold medal and not because of what it is â¦ but because of the man whose spirit it represents.â

The race was held during a snowfall. The early leader was Hans van Helden, who had already won bronzes in Innsbruck in the 1,500 and 5,000, and who finished in 15:02.02. Stensen was up two pairs later and started faster and finished faster than Van Helden, crossing in 14:53.30. In the eighth pair was Piet Kleine, who had won a silver medal in the 5,000.

He was the 1956 silver medalist, and had won most of the major meets at the distance since 1958, including the 1958 and 1959 World and European Championships. But he had recently struggled a bit, placing only seventh all-around and seventh at the distance at the recent 1960 World Championships, and although he had won the 1960 Europeans, his third consecutive all-around title at the meet, he had placed only third in the 10,000, won by Sweden Ivar Nilsson. The recent 5,000 gold medalist, Viktor Kosichkin, was also considered a challenger. The world record in the event was the vaunted 16:32.6, set by Hjalmar Andersen at Hamar, long ago in 1952, although it was tenuous. In 1959 it had been bettered at Chelyabinsk by Nikolajs Sjtelbaums with 16:31.4, and in January 1960 by both Sjtelbaums and Vladimir Shilykovsky at Medeo, but neither record was ratified by the ISU.
Unlike the men 1,500 and 5,000, the day of the 10,000 dawned with perfect weather, clear skies and no wind. In the second pair, Sweden Kjell BÃ¤ckman broke Andersen world record easily, finishing in 16:14.2. But it would eventually bring him only a bronze medal. Johannesen was up two pairs later. He set a fast pace, and was 10 seconds ahead of BÃ¤ckman at 5,600 metres. It seemed too fast, but it was not, and he would continue at that speed to the end, crossing almost 28 seconds ahead of BÃ¤ckman, and a full 46 seconds ahead of Andersen world record, in 15:46.6, the first 10K ever under 16 minutes. Kosichkin was in the sixth pair. Remarkably, he went out even faster than Johannesen and was ahead through 6,400 m, and they were tied at 7,600 metres, but the pace then wore on him. He finished in 15:49.2. A tremendous time, 44+ seconds better than the world record, it would bring him only a silver medal.
Johannesen 10K in Squaw Valley is considered one of the legendary performances in speed skating history, though the perfect weather, clear ice, and high altitude certainly contributed. Some speed skating experts thought the record would never be broken, but it lasted only until 1963. Johannesen would return in 1964 to complete his medal set in the event, winning a bronze. He was all-around World Champion in 1957 and 1964.

Due to warm weather, the race was cancelled after a few pairs and never concluded. Two decades later, the 10,000 m was once again the victim of weather conditions. Again, warm weather marred the competition after just a few pairs, although not as badly as the previous time. Unlike in 1928, the race was completed, and medals were awarded.
All top skaters raced in the early pairs, when the weather was still acceptable. However, the weather was not the only problem for the competitors; the thin St. Moritz air also proved a difficulty for many. One of them was 5,000 m bronze medallist GÃ¶the Hedlund, who had recorded a nice 17.17,1 in December. He had to give up in the first pair, which was won by his compatriot Harry Jansson. The other Swedish medal candidate, Ãke Seyffarth had been in doubt about starting the race, but these doubts proved ungrounded. He opened up a quick lead on Finland Pertti Lammio, which would only grow larger. Thanks to two impressive 41-second laps at the end, the clock stopped at a very respectable 17.26,3, with Lammio some 16 seconds behind that.
World Champion Lassi Parkkinen and Hungarian KornÃ©l Pajor contested the third pair, and both began their races faster than Seyffarth. At a third of the distance, Pajor lost connection with Parkkinen, who also gradually slowed. At 7,200 m, the Finn still came through in the same time as the leader, but he could not keep up the pace any longer, losing nearly 10 seconds in the remaining laps for second place. With the gold and silver medallists of the 5,000 m drawn in the next pair, Parkkinen was not expected to hold on to this position. However, a few puddles of water appeared on the track, as a sign of deteriorating weather conditions. Still, Reidar Liaklev managed to copy Seyffarth times and seemed headed for a medal, when he suddenly slowed noticeably. Like Hedlund, Liaklev suffered from the altitude, and stepped out of the race. Lundberg, nearly half a lap behind at that point, did finish the race. It would later turn out he was the only Norwegian to do so, finishing only in seventh. With temperatures rising, the standings did not change in the remaining pairs. Seyffarth victory marked the first Olympic title for Sweden.
While conditions were bad for all skaters after the fifth pair, Richard Solem was probably most affected. Because his opponent forfeited, he had to skate alone at the end of the programme. He consistently clocked lap times of over 1 minute and finished after 26.22,4, by far the worst time recorded in Olympic history. US journalist Ted Smits wrote: )[the ice] became so mushy by early afternoon that Richard Solem of Chicago, racing at the very end of the program after eight men had dropped out due to poor ice and the altitude, ploughed through slush up to the tubes of his skates. But he gamely finished, and his time of 26 minutes, 22.4 seconds attested to the ordeal. He was cheered for 19th place almost as loudly as the victor.)

After losing the gold due to an incorrect crossing at Vancouver, Kramer was looking for revenge, and his 5,000 m gold proved he was in shape. Kramer had also won the season only World Cup in this distance, although that race lacked his two main Dutch competitors, Jorrit Bergsma and Bob de Jong. Bergsma had beaten Kramer at the 2013 Worlds in Sochi, while De Jong - the 2006 champion - was competing in his fifth Olympics. Apart from the Dutchmen, defending Olympic champion Lee Seung-Hun and Belgian inline skater Bart Swings were considered for the medals. Several other contenders withdrew prior to the race. Russia Ivan Skobrev withdrew to focus on the team pursuit, as did the Norwegian entrants, who claimed the Dutch would be unbeatable. This earned the skaters a lot of criticism at home (from among others 1994 multiple Olympic champion Johann Olav Koss), especially after the bronze medal time turned out to be relatively weak and the Norwegian team failed to make the semi-finals in the team pursuit.
De Jong was the first of the favorites to skate, posting a stable and decent 13:07.19, but considering the track record stood 10 seconds faster, it seemed gold was out of the question. In the next pair, Bergsma and Swings raced each other. Bergsma departed with a 12:45 target time, which he managed with 12:44.45, a new lowland World Record and also a new Olympic Record. Swings had kept up with De Jong pace through 8,000 m, but eventually placed fifth. Bergsma time was comparable to Kramer 12:45.09 at the Dutch Olympic trials, which meant that the final pair would be exciting. Kramer took off a bit slower than Bergsma, but moved into first after 3,200 m. Kramer held on to his lead up until 3 laps before the finish, although gradually losing his lead in the previous laps. Knowing he couldnât match Bergsma fast final laps, Kramer slowed down a little to finish second in 12:49.02. After the race, Kramer revealed he had been suffering from a recurring back injury since the Olympic 5,000 m. For the fourth time in Sochi, the speed skating podium was swept by Dutch skaters - a record in any winter sport.
Jorrit Bergsma had hoped to compete at the 2010 Olympics. Competing in the Dutch marathon skating circuit, with races of 40 km, his coach Jillert Anema noticed that Bergsma and several of his team mates should be able to beat the best team pursuit squads. As they were unable to enter the strong Dutch national team, Anema contacted the federation of Kazakhstan. Bergsma won the Kazakh national title in late 2009, but the necessary paperwork to also compete internationally was not completed in time, and Bergsma and his teammates gave up on their dream of Vancouver. Fortunately for Bergsma, his Olympic dreams still came through four years later.

But Karlstad recent results had been less impressive, and he had only managed a seventh spot in the 5,000 m. Gustafson, who had won the 10,000 m at the European Championships, had won the 5,000 m and was also the runner-up from Sarajevo 1984, when he had missed the gold medal by just 0.05.
First medal contender to hit the ice was Gerard Kemkers, bronze medalist in the 5,000 m. In lap five, he fell - unusual for a 10,000 m. Despite a quick recovery, he lost about 10 seconds. While that was still enough to beat the Olympic Record at that point, the fall almost certainly cost him a medal. The first to beat Kemkersâ time was his compatriot, Leo Visser. The silver medalist in the 5,000 m, he had beaten 14 minutes a month earlier at the Dutch distance championships. This time, Visser ended at 14:00.55, which seemed insufficient for the title. This was soon proven by Austrian skater Michael Hadschieff. He had earlier medalled in the 1,500 m, and stood out in Calgary for having a red extension of his suit cap over his eyes. This was to protect his contact lenses from the dry Calgary air. Less visible was a plastic board he wore under his suit to improve aerodynamic profile. This apparently worked, as Hadschieff, who had earlier lost the 1988 European Championship bronze because of a poor 10,000 m, now skated a new personal best of 13:56.11 to take the lead. With Geir Karlstad falling out of contention after 7km, this left only Gustafson to beat Hadschieff. But the Swede was clearly faster, eventually winning by 8 seconds, the largest victory margin of his three Olympic titles. It was long uncertain if he would also be able to beat Karlstad world record. In the end, he managed it by three tenths.
Another remarkable competitor was Yoshiyuki Shimizu of Japan. While he finished only 28th out of 32 competitors, he did impress onlookers by re-tying the laces of one of his skates, while continuing to race.

Only hours before the race started Britain Greg Rutherford had won gold in the long jump, followed shortly by Jessica Ennis completing her heptathlon gold medal, with both victories bringing the pro-British crowd to a frenzy. The frenzy would only get more intense. The two-time defending champion was Ethiopian Kenenisa Bekele but he had had a difficult year with injuries and his form was not known coming into London. Britain posted their hopes on Mo Farah, silver medalist in the event at the 2011 World Championships. Farah would run together with his training partner, American Galen Rupp, both of them coached by 1984 Olympian and former marathon world-record golder Alberto Salazar.
Farah and Rupp wanted a slow pace and to kick off it, but the other finalists must not have heard that. Bekele ran 65.2 for the opening lap but then jogged through the second in 73.2 and the third lap was even slower. The pace was lethargic with 5K passed only in 14:05.79. It was only in the final three laps that the pace quickened with Farah taking the lead at the bell. He led throughout the final laps as the African runners could not get to him. On the final turn, Rupp moved into third and on the final straight he outsprinted Ethiopian Tariku Bekele to win silver behind Farah, who ran 53.4 for his final lap. The Olympic Stadium rocked for the third British gold in only a few hours.
Farah would come back seven days later to win the distance double of 5/10K. Rupp medal in the 10K was the first for an American since Billy Mills had won the event at the 1964 Olympics. Kenenisa Bekele trailed back in fourth in his attempt to three-peat.

He was World Champion in 1970-71 and European Champion in 1970 and 1972 and had already set 15 world records in his career. Schenk was trying to win all four races in Sapporo, but fell in his first few steps in the 500, finishing only 34th. But Schenk had already won two gold medals in Sapporo, the 1,500 and 5,000, when the 10K started, and he was the world record holder, having set the two most recent global marks, with his 14:55.9 at Inzell in March 1971 the current record.
But Schenk would have some work to do. In the second pair, Norway Sten Stensen finished in 15:07.08, respectable time on the Sapporo rink. The Netherlandsâ Kees Verkerk, in the fourth pair, bettered that with 15:04.70. Schenk started in the 12th pair. He started out quickly, moving ahead of pace from the start, and by 8,400 metres was five seconds better than Verkerk and Stensen. He slowed slightly coming home, but finished in 15:01.35 for his third gold medal, matching the feats of Clas Thunberg in 1924, Ivar Ballangrud in 1936, and Hjalmar Andersen in 1952.
Two weeks later, Schenk would win the 1972 World Championships, sweeping all four events, as he tried to do in Sapporo, the first person since Oscar Mathisen at the 1912 World Championships to pull off that feat. In his career, Schenk set 18 world records, won eight major international tournaments, and his distance titles are too numerous to mention. Schenk was awarded the Oscar Mathisen Trophy in 1970, 1971, and 1972, and is considered one of the greatest speed skaters of all-time.

After a failed race in 2006, a disqualification due to a bad lane change in 2010 and âpoorâ shape in 2014 (silver), he had his sights set on the PyeongChang 10,000 m. At the âgeneral repetitionâ, the 2017 World Championships at the Olympic oval, he had done well, winning gold in 12:38.89, the second fastest mark ever and fastest at sea-level. The world record was not held by Kramer but, since 2015, by Ted-Jan Bloemen, who had bettered the world record in 2015 to 12:36.30. Defending champion, Jorrit Bergsma, had also qualified despite poor performances earlier in the season, and Korea was hoping that 2010 champion Lee Seung-Hun could regain the gold.
Lee was the first of the favorites to race. He produced a steady race and a new personal best of 12:55.54, but considering the track record, this was not considered sufficient for a medal. This was confirmed when Bergsma took the ice. Speeding up slowly throughout the race, he lowered the Olympic Record to 12:41.98, and into medal contention. Next up was Bloemen, who departed faster, and posted faster lap times than Bergsma for the first half of the race. He then retained his advantage in the final laps, even pushing out a small sprint towards the end, resulting in 12:39.77. That gave Kramer a tough time to beat, but he was never in contention, and he produced a sub-par race with 13:01.02. This left the gold to Bloemen, the first Canadian man to win a speed skating gold since GaÃ©tan Boucher in 1984. His pairmate, Nicola Tumolero, surprisingly finished in third place, although his most notable performance until the Olympics had been winning the inaugural European 5,000 m title in a field without many top skaters. It made him the first Italian to medal in the sport since the Torino Olympics.

Kuts then put on a series of surges followed by dramatic slowing of the pace, attempt to lose the Briton. Finally, Kuts almost came to a stop, forcing Pirie to take the lead. When he did so, he looked in Pirie face and realized he was almost ashen from the effort, and at 8 km. Kuts sprinted ahead, never again challenged by Pirie, who struggled home in 8th place.

A distance specialist, Maier had set the last four world records in the 10K, including two in January 1968, and had already won the 5,000 in Grenoble. He seemed on form for a sure gold medal. He started in the first pair and his time of 15:23.9 was 26+ seconds under the Olympic record, only 3.6 seconds above his world record, and was the second fastest time ever. The gold seemed to be his. A challenger was thought to be Kees Verkerk (NED), but when he finished in 15:33.9 in the third pair, Maier seemed home free. But then Sweden Johnny HÃ¶glin started in the seventh pair. Though he had competed internationally since 1965, he had no significant reputation at any distance, and had never sniffed a podium before. But he hung on to Maier pace, almost equal to it through 8,400 metres. And he hung on, gradually pulling ahead in the next three laps, and finishing in 15:23.6 for one of the most improbable speed skating gold medals ever.
A few weeks later Maier would win the World Championships, and the 5 and 10K at that tournament. In 1968 he set seven world records, won both the European and World Championships and the 5 and 10K at both tournaments, won the 5,000 Olympic gold medal, but missed the one he wanted most. For HÃ¶glin, this was his career. He would mount the podium only one other time in a major international, at 1,500 metres at the 1974 European Championships. The bronze medalist, another Swede, was even more surprising. Ãrjan Sandler had competed around the world since 1964. But until the 1968 Winter Olympics, he had never finished better than 10th at any distance in any major meet.

The three favorites coming in were world record holder Joshua Cheptegei from Uganda, his teammate Jacob Kiplimo, and Ethiopia Selemon Barega. Kiplimo and Barega were only 20-years-old and had met 10 times at various distances, but never over 10,000 metres.
The day was not overly hot for the Tokyo summer, at 24Â° C. (75Â° F.), but it was run in a stifling 98% humidity. The early pace was set by Uganda Stephen Kissa who later explained that he was doing that âfor the team.â Although not running overly fast, his lead stretched to almost 50 metres as the field refused to go out too quickly because of the weather.
Kissa led to almost 6,000 metres when the pack reeled him in, but the field stayed together as the pace did not pick up until four laps remained. With 800 metres to go there were still 12 runners in the lead pack, and at the bell, eight runners remained in contention for the medals.
Barega led at the bell and sprinted almost the entire last lap, never being headed as he won the gold medal. Cheptegei and Kiplimo chased hard but could never catch him, and they would win silver and bronze, respectively, as form held almost perfectly. The pace had accelerated over the last few laps, with Barega finishing the last lap in 53.9, the final 800 in 1:53.9, and the final 1,600 in 4:00.9.

He was expected to be challenged by the defending champion, Pyotr Bolotnikov, the 1962 European Champion, and twice a world-record setter, and the 1960 5K champion, Murray Halberg of New Zealand. Clarke set a fast pace, surging every other lap. At 5K, only five leaders remained, but it was not who was expected. Besides Clarke, the pack included Tunisia Mohamad Gammoudi, Ethiopia Mamo Wolde, Japan Kokichi Tsuburaya, and a surprise American, Billy Mills. Tsuburaya was dropped in the sixth kilometer. At the bell, Clarke led, with Mills to his outside. But a lapped runner was between them, so Clarke moved out, pushing Mills into an outer lane, as Gammoudi moved past them both on the inside, quickly opening up a 10-metre lead. Clarke moved up to Gammoudi shoulder at the top of the stretch and passed him, but Gammoudi fought back. Then suddenly, as if an apparition had come upon them, Billy Mills sprinted past both and won by three metres over Gammoudi, Clarke getting the bronze medal.
Mills was completely unknown prior to the race. Asked if he was concerned about Mills, Clarke replied, âConcerned about him, I never heard of him.â One Japanese reporter asked Mills, âWho are you?â His victory is often considered the greatest upset in Olympic track & field history. Mills was part Sioux Indian, and worked for years after his victory as an inspirational leader for the betterment of Native Americans.

Even without his two Olympic titles, Andersen would have been the top favorite at Bislett. Since placing second behind Reidar Liaklev at the 1950 European Championships, Andersen had not lost a single 10,000 m. In 1949, he had become the first man to beat 17 minutes, and in 1952 had broken the world record two more times. After lowering the mark by 6 seconds in GjÃ¸vik, Andersen improved his own time by a staggering 20 seconds to 16.32,6, just a week before the Olympics. Kees Broekman and Pentti Lammio were second and third in that race, with the former also beating 17 minutes.
As during the 5,000 m, weather conditions were excellent, a few degrees below zero, no wind and a little sun. Andersen, again drawn early in the programme, set out for another steady race, although he could not copy his recent performance. After lapping his Japanese opponent, Andersen finished in 16.45,8, the second fastest 10,000 m ever. With the gold medal claimed by the Norwegian, the remaining skaters competed for the silver and bronze.
First up was Anton Huiskes, fourth in the 5,000 m. The Dutchman again started at a promising pace, but could not hold it to the end, finishing in 17.25,5. He was followed by Sverre Haugli, who had been one place ahead of Huiskes in the 5,000 two days earlier. This time, the tables were turned, and Haugli finished behind Huiskes. But neither of them would medal. The first to surpass them was Lammio. The Finn took five seconds off Huiskes time, and went into silver medal position.
After ice preparation, Kees Broekman, a prospective silver medalist, faced Carl-Erik Asplund of Sweden. The latter had placed sixth in the 5,000 and had a good track record in the 10,000 m, placing second in the event at the 1951 Europeans. Both skaters started fast and kept close to Andersen splits. But both eventually cracked, first Asplund, then Broekman. Broekman was just five seconds behind âHjallisâ at the halfway point, but lost over a second per lap in the second part, finishing with a 25-second gap to Andersen. Asplund managed to maintain a good pace as well, and completed his race 6 seconds behind the Dutchman, fast enough to beat Lammio for the bronze.

Norwegians Johann Olav Koss and Geir Karlstad had both already won Olympic gold in Albertville, and were looking for more.

Also competing for a medal was his team mate Robert Vunderink, a marathon skater, he did not regularly compete with long track skaters. Having set his sights on the Olympic 10,000 m, Vunderink had surprisingly beaten all aforementioned favorites in a December World Cup at Heerenveen.
Vunderink was the first of these four to ride. A slow starter, he eventually finished in 14:22.92. That assignment proved easy for Karlstad in the next pair, who did open a bit too fast, costing him in the latter part of the race. His time was 14:18.13. Koss, skating one pair later, trailed slightly behind Karlstad splits for most of his race. But he took advantage of his team mate slower final laps, and finished almost four seconds faster: 14:14.58. With the lap times of his opponents known, this gave Veldkamp the blue print for his own race. Leading the Norwegian by five seconds with seven laps to go, Veldkamp felt he had the gold in his hands, and slowed down slightly to win in 14:12.12. As in Karlstad win in the 5,000 m, Veldkamp gold medal was the first for the Netherlands since the 1976 Olympics.
After his gold medal, Bart Veldkamp set his sights on competing in the 1992 Summer Olympics. He hoped to become part of the Dutch team pursuit squad in track cycling, but was eventually not selected for the Games.

Koss, who was also the world record holder, was up against his compatriot Kjell Storelid (silver in the 5,000), defending champion Bart Veldkamp and the other Dutchmen (Falko Zandstra and Rintje Ritsma), as well as Poland Jaromir Radke, who had surprised with a third place at the European Championships, earlier that year at the Olympic venue.
Koss was the first of the favorites to race - and he essentially ended the competition. Like in the 5,000 metres, Koss produced an incredibly flat pace and ended in 13:30.55, breaking his own world record by 13 seconds. Of the remaining contenders, some tried to attack Koss times. Veldkamp had to let go of the schedule after 3K, Ritsma even sooner. Zandstra, Radke and Storelid didnât seriously attack Kossâ times, but instead gunned for the medals. Storelid managed this best, winning his second silver of the Games after slipping below Veldkamp times in the final five rounds. Veldkamp held on for bronze, but he wasnât there to see it. Thoroughly disappointed in his own performance, he had left the stadium and needed to be brought back before the medal ceremony could take place.
Kossâ time was not approached until the advent of the clap skate allowed skaters to go faster, with Gianni Romme breaking it at the 1998 Olympics. It also earned him the 1994 Oscar Mathisen Award for outstanding speed skating performance, and he was named Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year (together with Bonnie Blair).

Six days before, Gustafson had won the 5,000 m and he was the world record holder at this distance, having skated 14:23.59 at Medeo in 1982. This time had been beaten in December at Medeo by Igor Malkov. He had shattered the mark and broken the 14-minute barrier with 13:54.81 but it was not recognized as a world record by the ISU. Gustafson had also won the distance at the 1982 and 1984 European Championships and the 1983 World Championships. Gustafson started in the second pair, and set a top mark, finishing in 14:39.95, which looked like it could win the gold medal on the slow Sarajevo ice. Two pairs later, Malkov, who had won the silver medal at 5,000 behind Gustafson, and had won the 5,000 at the 1984 Europeans, started at a very consistent pace. With three laps remaining, he was over a second behind Gustafson pace, but he finished more strongly, and posted 14:39.90 to narrowly take the lead. Nobody came close to their times. In the third pair, East German RenÃ© SchÃ¶fisch, had finished in 14:46.91, which would win him the bronze medal, matching the bronze he had won in the 5,000. In 1988, Gustafson would win gold medals at Calgary in both the 5 and 10K. Malkov was the youngest ever Olympic gold medalist at the time, and remains so through 2006, at only 19 years, 8 days on the day of this event.

1004,"10,000 metres, Men",1956 Winter Olympics,35,Speed Skating,31 January 1956,"Pista di Misurina, Misurina",32 from 15 countries,na,na,"The favorite was Sweden Sigge Ericsson, the 1955 World and European Champion, who had won the 10,000 at both meets. The defending champion and world record holder was Norway Hjalmar Andersen, and he had won the distance most recently at the 1954 Europeans, but he was no longer the dominant skater he had been from 1950-52, having briefly retired in 1952-53. Another favorite was Soviet Oleg Goncharenko, runner-up at the 1954 and 1955 World Championships in all-around, who had won the 10,000 at the 1954 Worlds. Also to be considered was Norway Knut Johannesen, second at the distance at the 1955 World Championships.
Goncharenko was the first contender up, in the third pair, and he surprised everybody by breaking Andersen Olympic record with a time of 16:42.3. Johannesen was in the seventh pair, and went even faster, finishing in 16:36.9, after having been below world record pace for much of the race. Ericsson, who had been injured earlier in the season in a football match and had only recently recovered, was up three pairs later and set a very fast pace, even threatening Andersen world record of 16:32.6. At 8,000 metres, he was almost four seconds faster than Johannesen. He could not hold that pace, and slowed gradually in the final 2K, but he held on to win the gold medal by a full second, in 16:35.9. Hjalmar Andersen was in one of the late pairs and placed sixth in 16:52.6, despite having been ahead of Ericsson pace for the early part of the race.
This was the only 1956 speed skating event not won by a Soviet skater, who were making their Olympic dÃ©buts. For Ericsson this was the peak of his career and he would only compete internationally for one more year. Johannesen, however, had a long career ahead of him. He won the 1957 and 1964 World Championships in all-around and the European Championships in 1959-60, and was always formidable at the longer distances. In 1960 at Squaw Valley he would win the gold medal in this event, finishing the race in 15:46.6, finally breaking Andersen world record, set in 1952, and by a full 46 seconds.

1128,"10,000 metres, Men",2006 Winter Olympics,49,Speed Skating,24 February 2006,"Oval Lingotto, Torino",16 from 8 countries,na,na,"There had been only one international 10,000 m in the 2005/2006 season, but it had been extremely competitive. No less than four skaters broke the 13-minute barrier at the Heerenveen World Cup, with Carl Verheijen winning in a world record time. Verheijen lost his World Record on 31 December to Chad Hedrick, who set the mark at 12:55.11. Other medal hopefuls were the two other skaters to beat 13 minutes, Lasse SÃ¦tre and Eskil Ervik, and the other Dutchmen, 5000 m silver medalist Sven Kramer and Bob de Jong.
De Jong was the first of these favorites to start. He had medaled in the event at the World Championships every year since 1997, winning the title in 2003 and 2005. He had won an Olympic medal in the event in 1998, but had mysteriously struggled at the 2002 Games. His Torino race was steady and brought him a new personal best of 13:01.57, which seemed good, but not unbeatable. Yet, as the pairs went by, none could match the Dutchman time, his pairmate GrÃ¸dum still the runner-up after seven of eight pairs. The last pair featured the season two world record holders, Verheijen and Hedrick. The American started off fast, but by 4,000 m, he was trailing De Jong time. But Hedrick managed to consolidate, and only lost terrain slowly, eventually finishing about four seconds behind De Jong. Meanwhile, Verheijen had set his sights on GrÃ¸dum time, surpassing the Norwegian mark at 7,200 m for the bronze medal.

In February 1963, he had broken the supposedly unbreakable 15:46.6 world record of Knut Johannesen, set in winning the 1960 Winter Olympics gold medal. Johannesen was still formidable, having won the distance at the recent 1964 European Championships, and at the 1962 Europeans. But Nilsson had won the 10K at the 1962 and 1963 World Championships, and the 1963 European Championships. Nilsson was up in the first pair and he decided things early, posting 15:50.1, which would bring him the gold medal. When Johannesen, in the sixth pair, finishing in only 16:06.3, the battle for the gold appeared over. A few pairs later, Norwegian Fred Anton Maier, who had won a bronze medal two days before in the 5,000, came through with 16:06.0 which won him the silver medal, and pushed Johannesen back to the bronze. The first few pairs were contested without wind, but the wind was strong at the end of the event. The event was not without controversy. After Nilsson had skated, the Swedish referee, Sven LÃ¥ftman, allowed ice preparation after each pair, but the machine used left the ice in very poor condition. The Norwegians complained about this but the Swedes said that LÃ¥ftman was simply following the rules.
Nilsson would go on to win 10K races for several years, taking the distance at the 1965 European and World Championships, and the 1966 Europeans. He would set one more world record, but this one at 5,000 metres in 1965. Maier would repeat his silver medal in 1968 at Grenoble, and he would also win the distance in 1968 at the European and World Championships. But from 1966-68 he would also set the next four world records for the 10,000 m. Johannesen would win the 1964 World Championships a few weeks later, also winning the 5 and 10K at that meet, and he then retired. But his career had been a memorable one. At three Olympics he won five medals, two gold, two silver, and one bronze. He was all-around champion at the 1957 and 1964 World and the 1959-60 Europeans. A distance specialist, he won the 5,000 and 10,000 distances 11 times each at World and European Championships.

Sheffield Speed Skating Oval, Lake Placid",25 from 13 countries,na,na,"Eric Heiden celebrated his first four gold medals by going to watch the USA-Soviet Union ice hockey match the night before the 10,000. When the US won in a big upset, Heiden was excited, having two close friends on the US team, and he slept little. Oversleeping a bit, his breakfast consisted only of a few pieces of bread grabbed on the way to the rink. The first pair was a tough one with Norway Tom Erik Oxholm, who had won bronze in the 5,000, facing American Mike Woods, fourth at the 1979 World All-Arounds. Oxholm got off to a fast start on Woods, who never caught up, with Oxholm posting 14:36.60 and Woods 14:39.53.
Heiden was in the second pair with Soviet Viktor Lyoskin, the world record holder at 14:34.33, a top international competitor, and considered a formidable opponent. Heiden PR going into Lake Placid was 14:43.11 and Lyoskin tried to intimidate him, starting out at a suicidal pace, leading by over 2 seconds at eight laps. But Heiden skated his own race, steadily grinding Lyoskin down, catching him shortly after the 12th lap, and then crushing him in the second half of the race, eventually bettering his time by over 23 seconds. Heiden finished in 14:28.13, a remarkable world record considering the slow Lake Placid rink and it would bring him his unprecedented fifth gold medal.
This was the first time that any Olympic athlete had won five individual gold medals at a single Olympic Games, and that would not be equaled until Michael Phelps did so in swimming at Beijing in 2008. Oxholm would eventually win a bronze medal, with Woods finishing fourth, as the silver medal went to Dutchman Piet Kleine, the defending champion, who had been competing internationally since the early 1970s and went off in the sixth pair.

19020404,"10,000 metres, Men",2022 Winter Olympics,62,Speed Skating,11 February 2022,"National Speed Skating Oval, Olympic Green, Beijing",12 from 9 countries,na,na,"After his impressive win in the 5,000 m, Nils van der Poel had stirred up controversy in the speed skating world. Following a publication of an article about Dutch scientists conferring and perhaps influencing the ice maker for the National Speed Skating Oval, the Swedish skater had staged a press conference in which he accused the Dutch of trying to manipulate the sport. All parties â including ice maker Mark Messer (CAN) â denied any actual manipulation, and the race got underway without any formal protests or other impact.
As in the 5,000 m, Patrick Roest was the first favorite on the ice. Although his personal best of 12:35 had come at a similar rink, conditions and form forced Roest to a slightly slower schedule, which saw him end up at 12:44.59. That time was enough to survive the next two pairs, including the second Dutch skater, 2014 champion Jorrit Bergsma, who ended in 12:48.94.
Nils van der Poel seemed unimpressed by these times. As in the 5,000 m, he went off on a very steady schedule, recording a slowest lap of 30.38 (lap three) and speeding up to a final lap of 28.60. With these lap times, he handsomely defeated Roest again, but also bettered his own world record, which he had set at the 2021 World Championships. Behind the Swede, his pair mate Davide Ghiotto became the surprise of the race. After tagging along Van der Poel for a few laps, he settled into a pace that brought him to 12:45.98, enough for a bronze medal â the second in a row for Italy after Nicola Tumolero in 2018.
As he had already hinted at earlier, van der Poel announced his retirement from the sport after his second gold, although he hinted that he had tried to retire twice before and had failed. Remarkably, he also published a website that detailed his training methods as well as his training schedule since 2019.

There, Julius Skutnabb had recorded 18:02.4. Skutnabb was a veteran, 34 years old. He had already competed internationally prior to World War I, and was still among the top skaters when competition resumed in the 1920s.
Skutnabb was drawn against his teammate, Clas Thunberg. He had already won two Olympic titles and was virtually certain of the allround gold as well. He was not considered a strong 10000 m skater, and the two struck a deal to help Skutnabb win a gold medal as well. The plan worked perfectly, as they recorded the first and second best times of the competition. The Norwegians, who had been 1-2-3 up to that time moved down in the standings. The only remaining Norwegian was Frithjof Paulsen, a long distance specialist. With 18:13.0, he fell just short of the medals.
Chamonix would become Skutnabb lucky rink, as he won his only other major title there as well. In 1926, he won the European Championships with three distance victories out of four races.

He was planning on competing in the marathon, and possibly the 10K, but was declared a professional shortly before the Olympics and could not compete. That left the event wide open. In the race, Finns Volmari Iso-Hollo and Lauri âLasseâ Virtanen pulled away early with Poland Janusz KusociÅski. By 8K, Virtanen was dropped. KusociÅski won the gold medal when he kicked past Iso-Hollo on the final curve and was well ahead before slowing down in the stretch. Iso-Hollo would return six days later to win the steeplechase gold medal. The precise placements after 6th are disputed but the version we use is the most accepted. During World War II KusociÅski worked for the Polish resistance. He was discovered by the Gestapo in March 1940 and was arrested and tortured, and eventually executed on 21 June 1940.

The 1958 Commonwealth Games champion, Dave Power of Australia, set the early pace. Only Soviets Pyotr Bolotnikov and Aleksey Desyatchikov and the GDR Hans Grodotzki could stay with him. Bolotnikov took a big lead on the penultimate lap and was never caught, winning by almost five seconds. Though it was his first major title, he would win the 1962 Europeans and set a world record in the event in October 1960 and broke that in 1962.

Bekele had also won the International Cross-Country from 2002-2004, and had broken Geb world record earlier in 2004 and was favored in Athens. After seven laps, the Ethiopians (including Sileshi Sihine) took off and forced the pace.

Having swept the medals at the 1998 Olympics, they had finished 1-2 at all World Championships since. Three of them had won the world title: 1998 Olympic Champion Gianni Romme (1998, 2000), 1998 silver medalist Bob de Jong (1999) and Carl Verheijen (2001). Reigning World Champion Verheijen had not made the Dutch team, however, but with Jochem Uytdehaage, winner of the Olympic 5,000 m, he had a decent replacement. The best non-Dutch prospect was Frank Dittrich. The German had been bronze medallist at the World Championships 1998-2000 and had won the only World Cup competition at the distance earlier that season, when none of the Dutch skaters even made the podium.
Defending champion Romme had only narrowly qualified at the Dutch trials, suffering from illness at the time. The first of the favorites to skate in Salt Lake City, he set out to break his world record of 13:03.40, which he had set in late 2000. Still not in his 1998 form, he set out fast, as usual, but faded sooner than expected. His 13:10.03 was still one of the fastest ever 10,000 m recorded. Having won two Olympic medals already, much was expected from Jochem Uytdehaage. The Dutchman set out for a very tight schedule, recording lap times between 30.64 and 31.48. Not only did this result in a new world record, his time of 12:58.92 also made him the first man to beat 13 minutes in the 10,000 m.
With these results, the first two places seemed secure, and the bronze was to be decided in the very last pair. Frank Dittrich, known for his fast final laps, was paired with Lasse SÃ¦tre of Norway, known for his ability to )die and resurrect) during a race. The two remained close at first, with SÃ¦tre pulling away around the half-way point. While the German final sprint did not come, SÃ¦tre skated to a new personal best and a bronze medal.

Mathiesen opened with 17:41.2, a new Olympic Record. This time was challenged by Max Stiepl in the third pair. The 10 km was the Austrian best event: he had won it twice at European Championships, and had finished second to Wasenius in the World Championships at Davos prior to the Olympics. His final time of 17:30.0 was more than 20 seconds faster than his time at the fast Swiss rink, and a medal looked certain. Much depended on the next race, between Ivar Ballangrud and Birger Wasenius. Both skaters had won medals in the previous days, but Wasenius had not yet beaten Ballangrud. The two went out much faster than Stiepl, and were neck-to-neck for 4 kilometres. Ballangrud then started to edge ahead, taking a little more advantage each lap. Towards, the end, Wasenius crept back a little, but could not close the 5-second gap.
Wasenius split time at the bell was equal to that of Stiepl, but he won nearly two seconds in that last lap, for his second silver medal of the Games, and third medal in all. Ballangrud improved on his season best with 17:24.3, only seven seconds from the World Record.

This left the event open for his teammate Ville Ritola who won in world record time of 30:23.2. The only runner who kept pace with Ritola at all was Sweden Edvin Wide but he was dropped at 4K. Wide would finish his Olympic career after 1928 with four bronze medals and one silver. Shortly after the 1924 Olympics, Nurmi showed what he was capable of, running 30:06.2 in Kuopio for a world record that would last 13 years.
One controversy concerning the 1924 10K relates to the number of runners on the race. The 1924 Official Report implies that there were 43 starters, but this number is felt to be wrong. Photographs of the race have been used in attempts to determine the number of runners, which is likely somewhere between 30 and 35. Two runners who may have competed were Eritreans Mareg Mangaschia and Tacle Redda who were entered for Italy. But Italian athletics historians are divided on whether or not they actually competed and the best evidence states that they did not. It is unlikely the exact start list will ever be known with precision.

Norwegian Bernt Evensen, who had won Olympic medals of each colour already, competed against Irving Jaffee (USA), who had just missed the podium in the 5000 m. The Norwegian led from the start, but Jaffee never trailed by more than three seconds. In the final laps, the American slowly crept closer. With 100 m to go, he was still behind, but with an excellent sprint, he nudged his skate over the finish line first. This was a major upset.
The times of Evensen and Jaffee already indicated the ice conditions were poor, and they were getting worse by the minute. Thaw had set in due to the Swiss FÃ¶hn-wind, and puddles of water were forming on the ice by the second race. The third pair saw co-favorite Roald Larsen forfeit when his split times were half a minute behind the leaders. Armand Carlsen, the Norwegian who had bettered the World Record nine days ago (17:17.4) did complete his race, but his time of 20:56.1 was much slower than all others. A clear indicator of the situation was that Carlsen was half a minute slower than Lithuanian Bulota, whom he had beaten by over two minutes in his World Record race. The fifth pair between Andersson of Sweden and Blomqvist of Finland did get underway, but when lap times went over 50 seconds, the referee ended competition. With temperatures having reached 25ÂºC, there was no chance of the race being resumed the same day. The race results were annulled.
The Americans (and Canadians) protested against this, pointing to poor weather circumstances during the 500 and 5000 m races the previous day. They would accept a postponement but not cancellation. The Swiss organizers then briefly announced Jaffee as the champion, although this message was accompanied by the ambiguous note that âanother competition should be held before the close of the Winter sports programâ. Their decision was overturned by the International Skating Union, who had the final say in the matter. The American protest was disallowed on grounds that they had submitted it too late, and the race remained cancelled. Briefly, there was hope for a re-run, but when the weather remained warm, most of the competitors left Switzerland, leaving the 10000 m without a winner. Jaffee was somewhat satisfied being congratulated by the Norwegians competitors, who had come to his hotel. He would have his revenge in four years.
Some observers pointed to the Sankt Moritz hotels as the main culprit for the cancellation of the 10000 m. Not wanting to damage their business, they had pressed for the Games to be held late in the season, risking higher temperatures. However, weather records showed that the FÃ¶hn had never set in this early in winter.

The heavy favorite was Ethiopia Tirunesh Dibaba, who had never lost a 10K race, and had won the World Championships in 2005 and 2007. The race was a final only and was held in high heat and humidity, especially considering the start time. The early lead was taken by Lornah Kiplagat, a Kenyan-born Dutchwoman. She powered thru 5K in 15:09.98, shredding the field as only 10 remained in the lead pack at that point. Kiplagat led thru almost 7K, when she fell back, the lead taken by Turkey Elvan Abeylegesse, with Dibaba moving into second. With a kilometer remaining, they had 10 seconds on the chasers. Abeylegesse led to the bell, when Dibaba surged ahead and had five metres on the Turk by the final curve, when she opened up even more, winning by 15 metres. Her time of 29:54.66 made her only the second woman to run under 30 minutes, and she also pulled Abeylegesse under the barrier as well (29:56.34). American Shalane Flanagan moved into third place with 600 metres remaining. But because the field was so strung out, she was not certain of her place. She won the bronze medal but did not realize that until being told after the race. Dibaba returned a week later to win the 5K, becoming the first woman to win the distance double at the Olympics.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected.
In March 2017 Elvan Abeylegesse of Turkey was revealed to have a positive re-test from the 2007 World Championships for stanozolol, and was disqualified, losing her silver medal. She was given a two-year ban from the time of the 2007 Worlds, which negated her 2008 Olympic results. American Shalane Flanagan was moved up to the silver medal, while Kenyan Linet Masai received the bronze medal. Abeylegesse was also disqualified from the 5,000 metres, in which she also initially received a silver medal.

She was expected to be challenged by Kenya Hellen Obiri who had trailed Hassan for silver in the 5K, and Ethiopia Letesenbet Gidey, who was the world record holder.
The 10K was a final only event, as it had been since 2004 at the Olympics. As in the 5K Japan Ririka Hironaka took the field through the early laps, leading for two kilometres at a dawdling pace before Gidey went to the lead at 3,000 metres, realizing she had to do something to blunt Hassan kick.
By five kilometres only seven runners remained in medal contention, and Gidey took the field to 6,000, as only she, Hassan, Obiri, and Bahrain Kalkidan Gezahegne remained together. Gidey kept the pace fast and Obiri would soon drop back. Over the final kilometre Gidey slowed slightly, unable to maintain the quick tempo that had been unable to drop Hassan. She still led over the last lap until Hassan turned on the burners off the last turn and Gidey could not answer. She would drop back to the bronze medal position, while Gazahegne challenged on the final straight, but Hassan was never in danger and won the gold medal.
For Sifan Hassan this completed a remarkable distance triple â gold in the 5,000 and 10,000 and a bronze medal in the 1,500. No woman had ever even run all three races before at a single Olympics, and it had only been done five times by men, with the best performance by Kenyan distance pioneer Kip Keino at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics, where he won 1,500 gold and 5K silver.

That left the lead to the Ethiopian team of Ejegayehu Dibaba, 1992 and 2000 champion Derartu Tulu, and Werknesh Kidane, China Xing Huina, and Kenya Lornah Kiplagat. Xing was somewhat unheralded but had set a world junior record of 30:31.55 at the 2003 Worlds. This group stayed together until the last lap, when Dibaba took off, chased by Xing. Off the last turn, Xing pulled ahead for the gold medal, but it was Dibaba who celebrated. Dibaba did not realize that Xing was on the same lap, thinking she had been lapped. She raised her hands joyfully as she crossed the line, but it would only be for the silver medal.

Kenyan Alice Aprot took the early lead and held it through 5,000 metres, passed in 14:46.81, a PR for her for the shorter distance, but Ayana was right behind her in 14:47.1. They remained like that through 13 laps when Ayana decided to start her time trial, running the next lap in 66.5. Only Vivian Cheruiyot was anywhere near her at the end of the lap.
Ayana continued, running metronomic laps to the finish, shattering the world record by running 29:17.45. The previous official world record was 29:31.78 by China Wang Junxia but that mark was considered almost certainly performance-aided, and most track stat freaks felt the true world best was the 29:53.80 set by Meselech Melkamu in 2009. Thus, Ayana time was over 36 seconds faster than that mark. She ran the second 5K in 14:30.4, her last 3,000 in 8:47.5, and the final four laps in 4:41.5.
Behind Ayana, the top 13 runners were pulled to PRs and there were multiple national records set. Cheruiyot finished in 29:32.53, followed by Ethiopian Tirunesh Dibaba in 29:42.56, with Aprot missing the podium with 29:53.51. The 2-4 finishers were thus also under what was considered the legitimate world record. American Molly Huddle finished sixth in a national record 30:13.17, as did Sweden Sarah Lahti in 12th with 31:28.43, Burundi Diane Nukuri-Johnson in 13th with 31:28.69, and Greece Alexia Pappas in 17th in 31:36.16.

Her biggest challenger was expected to be Kenyan Vivian Cheruiyot, the 2011 World Champion. But the race saw the Japanese threesome of Kayoko Fukushi, Hitomi Niiya, and Mika Yoshikawa forge an early 25-metre lead on the first two laps, joined by Irish runner Fionnuala Britton. The pack reeled them in on the fourth lap, but the three Japanese still led through nine laps. The pace was steady and the field was together for 4,000 metres. At 5,000 metres Kenyan Sally Jepkosgei Kipyego went to the lead and increased the pace. When she pushed the sixth kilometre in 3:00.02 the field spread out, with only Dibaba, her two Ethiopian teammates, Kipyego, Cheruiyot, and Bahrain Shitaye Eshete in the lead group. At 8,000 metres the group was four, with Werknesh Kidane (ETH), Kipyego, Cheruiyot, and Dibaba left to contest the medals. Dibaba bided her time but with 600 metres left went to the front, and surged ahead, pulling away to defend her gold medal with almost a six-second margin. Kipyego was the only one who tried to go with her, and she would win the silver, four seconds ahead of Cheruiyot bronze placement.
The victory made Dibaba the first woman to defend the 10K gold medal, although her cousin, Derartu Tulu, had won the event in 1992 and 2000. One week later, Dibaba would attempt to repeat the 5/10K double, but could finish only third in the 5K. In that race, Cheruiyot would win another medal with a silver. The pace was fast enough in this race that Dibaba 30:20.75 was the fastest time of the year and 13 of the top 14 would record either a PR or a yearly best, with Eshete setting a national record.

Rather the event was skied in two sections on the same day, with classical skied first, followed by the freestyle pursuit, both sections now over 10 km. In the morning the leader of the classical ski was Spain Johann MÃ¼hlegg, who had changed citizenship from Germany to ski for the Spanish team in 1999. He led Norway Frode Estil by 13.2 seconds with Anders Aukland in third, another 7.2 back. In the afternoon, MÃ¼hlegg won the event easily, winning by almost 30 seconds, with Estil and his teammate Thomas Alsgaard dead-heating in what appeared to be a tie for second. Alsgaard had been only 15th after the classical section, but had the fastest time in the freestyle to catch Estil. Apparently in fourth place was Sweden Per Elofsson, the 2001 World Champion, and World Cup champion in 2000-01 and 2001-02.
But nine days later all the standings changed. MÃ¼hlegg failed a doping test after the 50 km race, and was stripped of his gold medal in that event. The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) then ruled in 2003 that he could also be retroactively stripped of his gold medals in the pursuit and 30 km. Thus, MÃ¼hlegg was disqualified from this race, and Estil and Alsgaard declared co-champions, with Elofsson moving up to the bronze medal. But that did not happen quickly, as the medals were not re-distributed until 22 months after the race.

Need any more convincing?
DÃ¦hlie went off with an 8-second lead over Markus Gandler, who was not considered a challenger, but it was 16 seconds back to Finland Mika MyllylÃ¤, who had been third in the 10 km, and 21 seconds to Vladimir Smirnov, perhaps the best skier in the past five years not named BjÃ¸rn DÃ¦hlie. And then a miracle occurred â DÃ¦hlie was beaten. He actually skied rather poorly, for him, in the freestyle pursuit phase, posting only the seventh fastest time. But none of the above caught him, instead it was his teammate Thomas Alsgaard, who started fifth, 24 seconds in arrears. Alsgaard caught up to DÃ¦hlie by eight kilometers, and then sat in behind him for 20 minutes to conserve his strength. DÃ¦hlie tried to pull away but that didnât work. He tried to slow down and get Alsgaard to take the lead, but that didnât work. What worked was Alsgaard sprint, started at 200 metres out, which pulled him ahead with 50 metres to the line, and brought him ahead by 1.1 seconds. Smirnov also struggled in freestyle, posting only the 11th best time, but his overall race brought him with a bronze medal.

The defending champion was BjÃ¸rn DÃ¦hlie of Norway, who had won the 1993 World Championships, and had already won the 10 km classical, meaning he started first off in the freestyle pursuit section of this race. There was little doubt who would win, as DÃ¦hlie was considered stronger in freestyle than classical. His biggest competition was expected to come from Kazakhstan Vladimir Smirnov. At the 1993 World Championships, they had been 1-2 in a photo finish, which at first looked like Smirnov had won. His torso was first across the line, but on review, DÃ¦hlie boot crossed the line first, which is the determining factor. Smirnov had been second in the 10 km classical in Lillehammer, so he would start only 18 seconds behind DÃ¦hlie. But it might as well have been 18 minutes. DÃ¦hlie was never caught, posted the freestyle leg, and won the pursuit by 29.2 seconds over Smirnov. Smirnov time was second in freestyle only to DÃ¦hlie, and he was over a minute ahead of the bronze medalist, Italy Silvio Fauner.
This was Fauner first individual Olympic medal. He would win three in the relay, including a gold in Lillehammer, and add another individual medal in the 30 km in 1998. Smirnov and DÃ¦hlie were fighting out the World Cup race for the fourth consecutive season. Smirnov had won it in 1990-91, with DÃ¦hlie winning in 1991-92 and 1992-93, with Smirnov second in 1993 and third in 1992. In 1993-94 Smirnov would edge out the Norwegian for the seasonal title.

He had difficulty keeping on the wheel of his teammates and finally, after several minutes of this problem, collapsed off his bike. He was taken to hospital and died a few hours later. The official verdict was initially given as a victim of sunstroke (heat stroke), although other reports mention that he had sustained a fractured skull during his fall. Media reports noted that the Danish team doctors admitted giving Jensen Roniacol, a vasodilator, and initial reports attributed his death to drugs. However, the post-mortem examination was never directly released and drugs as a cause of his death has never been proven, but in Davis Maraniss book Rome 1960: The Olympics that Changed the World, he noted, âDecades later a Danish journalist tracked down Doctor Alberto Marpiori, one of  the Italians who had performed Jensen autopsy. The doctor said that he remembered the case well as it was the first time his institute had found evidence of doping. He said several substances, including amphetamines, were found in Jensen system.â Jensen death, along with the later death of Tom Simpson in the 1967 Tour de France, were two of the high-publicity factors that pushed the International Olympic Committee to institute drug testing at the 1968 Olympics.

He swam as far as he could underwater after the push-off, often not emerging on top of the water until the 35-40 metre mark. This usually gave him a big lead at the turn, and it was so advantageous that the other swimmers had to adopt the technique, although Berkoff usually still led through the first 40.

As soon as the Seoul Olympics ended, Berkoff underwater start was banned, with the new rule requiring that backstrokers surface and begin stroking on top of the water by 10 metres.

He was World Swimmer of the Year in 1980, and in 1981 finally bettered the 100 freestyle world record with 49.36. By 1984 he was not the swimmer he had been in 1980 but hoped to make up for having to miss the 1980 Olympics. In the end he came through for the gold medal but not without some controversy. The runner-up was Australian Mark Stockwell, and he was upset, thinking the start had not been fair, âI donât want to take away anything from Rowdy. I mean, he great. He been around for a long time and he knows what to look out for. It just wasnât a fair start.â Stockwell teammate Peter Evans, not in this event, was furious, telling him, âYou were robbed, mate.â
The starter had been Panamanian Frank Silvestri who had done similar duty at the 1982 World Championships and 1983 Pan American Games, and the American coaches knew of him. They knew he was quick on the trigger for the start and had warned Gaines to be ready. Anticipating that Gaines had an early lead and hung on in the final 25 metres, telling himself, âI canât stop now, this is my last 25 ever.â In the end the Australian protest was disallowed and Gaines won the gold medal with Stockwell taking silver. Gainesâ time of 49.80 broke the Olympic record set in 1976 by Jim Montgomery, which was the first time the 50-second barrier had been broken.

The only real threat to Popov was Gary Hall, Jr., an American with whom Popov had a spikey relationship. As expected the two men led the qualifying times and were placed next to each other for the final. At 50 metres Hall enjoyed a small lead over Popov but this was lost when the Russian made the better turn. Hall responded and pulled level but a finishing burst from Popov was decisive and he became the first man to retain the Olympic 100 metres freestyle title since Johnny Weissmuller in 1924. Gustavo Borges of Brazil added a bronze medal to the silver medal he won in the same event in 1992.

However the 100 free was Biondi best race, as he had dominated it since 1985 and held the 10 fastest times in history coming into Seoul. In the final he went out in 23.21, ahead of his world record split of 23.25. He did not finish as strongly as he had at the US Trials when he set the record, but came home in 48.63, the second fastest time ever to win the gold medal.
Behind Biondi, American Chris Jacobs placed second in 49.08, the fastest non-Biondi time in history. In 1986 no one would have expected this as Jacobs was in the throes of cocaine addiction and entered rehab that year. Jacobs had first started doing drugs when he was only 12, but set age-group swim records despite his use. At the University of Texas he became a heavy drug user, and dropped out of school and swimming in his junior year. The Texas coach, Eddie Reese, called his parents and two days later Jacob father arrived at his room in Texas to take him home. He told his parents everything, and they then enrolled him at the Fair Oaks Hospital in Summit, a rehabilitation facility. Two years later Chris Jacobs stood on the podium in Seoul, an Olympic medalist.

In that event, Sweden Gunnar Larsson and American Tim McKee seemingly tied in 4:31.98, but the electronic timer broke that tie, giving the Swede the gold by a margin of 2/1000ths of a second. It was decided after that race, that this was too close, as the margin could be affected by irregularities in the paint on a lane, so all swimming races since 1972 that were tied to the 1/100th would be considered ties.
The early leader in the final of this race was Dutchwoman Annemarie Verstappen, who was ahead at the turn. In the final 50 metres the Americans Carrie Steinseifer and Nancy Hogshead passed her and came to the wall together, literally together. They both finished in 55.92, although the scoreboard initially showed Steinseifer as the winner, but that was quickly changed to a tie for first between Steinseifer and Hogshead.

This culminated at the 1994 World Championships where Chinese female swimmers won 19 medals including 12 golds. Skeptics noted that Chinese men had not won a single medal at these championships and pointed the similarity of these performances to those of swimmers of the German Democratic Republic during their glory years of the 1970s and 80s. The most outspoken critics also noted that a number of coaches from the now discredited East German regime were now plying their trade in China. These fears appeared to be proved true when eleven athletes tested positive for dihydrotestosterone at the 1994 Asian Games.
Le Jingyi was the only one of this generation of Chinese swimmers who arrived at the Atlanta Olympics as the clear favourite. Although she was not swimming as fast as she had done in 1994 she was still comfortably the best over the distance and was a relatively easy winner of the Olympic title.
Sandra VÃ¶lker of Germany took the silver medal ahead of US team captain Angel Martino.

At the US Olympic Trials Jenny Thompson swam 54.48 in the preliminaries to better Otto mark. She was favored in Barcelona, although her teammate, Nicole Haislett, 1991 World Champion and runner-up at 1991 Pan Pacs, was expected to be her biggest competition.
In the final, China Zhuang Yong surprisingly led Thompson at the turn, 26.46 to 26.54. But Thompson strong finish never came and Zhuang held on to win the gold medal, Thompson later saying, âI just choked hard coming home and I donât know why.â
This was the first individual Olympic medal for Thompson, who would compete at the 1996, 2000, and 2004 Olympics, finishing her career with 12 Olympic medals, eight of them gold. But an individual gold medal would always elude her. Third-place in this event would go to German Franziska van Almsick, also beginning an Olympic career that would last through 2004. Van Almsick would win 10 Olympic medals, but like Thompson she would be frustrated, in her case never managing any Olympic gold.

American Edmund Minahan, however, started at 6.0 metres and it was too much for Pritchard to overcome as Minahan won the final, followed by US runner Bill Holland.
Edmund âCottonâ Minahan had attended Georgetown University and was highly unusual for an Olympian in this era, as he was the first Olympic athlete to later play major league baseball, playing one season as a pitcher for the Cincinnati Reds in 1907, although he only played two games.

His heat times were not remarkable but he was unpressed in both rounds.  Frank Jarvis and Walter Tewksbury, however, both posted a new world record of 10.8 in winning their heats.
In the heats of this event, the French starter Meier, proved incompetent and was soon replaced by the well-known British starter George F. Sandford.  The start of the final was described as very even, but at the halfway mark, Duffey had opened up a lead of a metre.  Suddenly he fell to the track, having pulled a muscle badly.  The others finished close together, about one yard separating the three finishers, but Frank Jarvis took the title in 11.0 seconds.
Duffey was the greatest sprinter since Bernie Wefers.  In 1902, he ran 100 yards in 9.6 seconds and he won several IC4A, AAU, and AAA championships, but his name is not to be found in the record books.  In 1905, he was declared a professional by AAU president James Sullivan, and Sullivan ordered all Duffey marks expunged from the records.  Duffey crime, according to Charles Paddock, was that he chose to wear running shoes made by an English company, and not by the New York company with which Sullivan was affiliated.

Hahn had won the sprint double at the 1903 U.S. and Canadian championships, and he again won the AAU 220 in 1905.  Though he was only 5-6, in 1906 he would become the first person to win the Olympic 100 twice, a feat not duplicated until 1984-88 by Carl Lewis.

Unlike the 1896 Olympics, it could be said that all the top hurdlers were present, mainly because Al Kraenzlein was so dominant that he had no real peer.
The heats bore no surprises, as the favored Kraenzlein qualified easily.  In the final, the first real problem with the inexperienced French starter Meier, occurred.  John McLean caught a flyer, and according to reports, was ahead of Kraenzlein by five yards off the blocks.  But Kraenzlein was so superior that he caught McLean at the eighth hurdle and ran away to win by three yards.  McLean did hold onto second place, however, just edging out Fred Moloney, who had beaten McLean easily in a first-round heat.
Kraenzlein win in the 110 metres hurdles was the first of his four individual gold medals, a record which has still never been equalled in track & field athletics.  The distance of 110 metres was rarely run in either Britain or the United States, as they used the slightly shorter Imperial equivalent of 120 yards.

Only 30 biathletes are allowed to start, based on World Cup points. The skiers have four shooting stations, shooting five shots at each, with each missed target forcing the biathlete to ski a penalty loop. A lapped skier must withdraw from the race. The 2005 World Champion was Norway Gro Marit Istad Kristiansen who did not qualify for the race based on her World Cup points. The runner-up in 2005 had been Sweden Anna-Carin Olofsson, who had already won a silver medal in Torino in the sprint. A former cross-country skier, she took the lead early, and was never headed, missing only one target during the race, and winning Sweden first biathlon gold since the first Olympic biathlon event in 1960, won by Klas Lestander. Kati Wilhelm, who had won the pursuit a week before, narrowed the gap to 9.6 seconds but Olofsson pulled away on the final lap. Wilhelm would win silver, followed by her teammate Uschi Disl. For Disl, this was her final attempt to win an individual gold medal in her fifth Winter Olympics. Disl would finish her career with nine Olympic medals, the most ever for women, with two relay gold medals, four silvers and three bronzes. At the World Championships she won 19 medals, including eight golds. Wilhelm was still active going into Vancouver in 2010, placing second in the 2008-09 World Cup. Through 2009 she had won 13 World Championship medals, including five golds. At the Olympics, she had won three gold and three silver medals, three in Salt Lake City, and three in Torino.

Treacherous gusts at the shooting range blew away the prospects of several favourites in the supreme discipline of biathlon. The beneficiary was Justine Braisaz-Bouchet, who won the first gold for the French female biathletes at these Games, and crossed the finish line waving the tricolour. She won with a comfortable margin of 15.3 seconds over Norway Tiril Eckhoff. Norway also won bronze, as Marte Olsbu RÃ¸iseland finished third.
All three medallists, and the fourth placed MarkÃ©ta DavidovÃ¡, each had four shooting penalties. Only Yuliya Dzhima from Ukraine had less than four penalties, but she finished seventh.
Braisaz-Bouchet is only the second woman representing France to win an individual event in biathlon at the Winter Olympics. She laid the foundation for her victory on the third standing stage, where she was the only one in the top eight to shoot clean.
Tiril Eckhoff had an excellent start with two clean shoots. She was also the fastest skier but lost her advantage with long shooting times owing to the unpredictable wind. Nevertheless, she won silver, which was her third medal in the event, having captured bronzes in 2014 and 2018. She also completed a full set of medals in biathlon at Beijing, adding the silver to the gold she won in the mixed relay, and the pursuit bronze.
Olsbu RÃ¸iseland was among the top three throughout the competition. She was only 1.5 seconds behind Eckhoff after the final shooting, but could never close the gap and eventually lost another 18.1 seconds on the final loop. Olsbu RÃ¸iseland was the outstanding female biathlete of the Winter Games with three gold and two bronze medals.

The Beijing race took place in difficult weather conditions, but Fillon Maillet made no mistakes in heavy snowfall, bitterly cold temperatures (-14Â°C), and icy winds in the Zhangjiakou National Biathlon Centre.
The silver medal went to Tarjei BÃ¸ (+28.6 seconds), and bronze went to Eduard Latypov (+35.3 seconds), both with one penalty. Latypov was ahead of BÃ¸ for most of the race but lost 15.9 seconds on the last loop and had to settle for bronze.
Tarjei brother, Johannes Thingnes BÃ¸, who started with a comfortable lead of 41.0 seconds after the sprint, experienced an unfortunate race. In his third round of shooting, he had the worst of the conditions. In total, the 28-year-old went into the penalty loop seven times (0-2-3-2). However, because of his outstanding skiing speed, BÃ¸ still finished fifth. None of the other top six biathletes missed more than one target.
Veteran Lukas Hofer was the only other athlete other than Fillon Maillet with a clear shooting performance, but eventually placed fourth, losing the medal due to slowing down on the track in the last third of the race.

The leader in that event starts off, and then every skier after him would start behind by the time margin from the sprint. Only the top 60 finishers from the sprint were eligible to start, but in reality, many of the lower finishers would elect not to start this race. For the men, only 57 eventually started in Salt Lake City. The pursuit had been contested at the World Championships since 1997.
The favorite was Ole Einar BjÃ¸rndalen, who had already won the 20 km and 10 km sprint in Salt Lake City, and thus started with a 29-second lead. Also to be considered was France RaphaÃ«l PoirÃ©e, who had won the seasonal World Cup in 1999-2000 and 2000-01, and would win again in 2002, but he had finished a disappointing ninth in the sprint, and would start 1:06 behind BjÃ¸rndalen.

Given that the outcome of the 10 kilometres event had largely been affected by the weather conditions, it was felt unlikely that the medallists from that event would end on the podium after the 12.5 kilometres pursuit section. For Emil Hegle Svendsen of Norway and Croatia Jakov Fak, who started 2nd and 3rd, this proved to be the case, these biathletes eventually finishing in 8th and 25th place respectively. In the end it was the Swede Bjorn Ferry and Christoph Sumann of Austria who started at 1:12 and 1:25 behind the first starter Vincent Jay, who moved from 8th to 1st and 12th to 2nd , respectively, to take the gold and silver medals. Jay did well to hold on to the bronze medal by 2.8 seconds from another Austrian, the fast finishing Simon Eder, mainly by virtue of his time in the 10 kilometres event.
Ferry, an outspoken opponent of doping in sport, had competed at the top level since 2001 but had never previously won a medal at world or Olympic level. His wife, Heidi Andersson, was an eight-time world champion in the sport of arm-wrestling.

Next on the course was Cologna, who used Olsson splits for guidance, and was by far the fastest skier in the last 7 km, finishing 28.5 seconds ahead of the Swede to win the gold. While Niskanen was already hoping to win the first cross-country medal for his country in Sochi, Swede Daniel Richardsson, starting 43rd, finished strongly to take the bronze medal by a mere 0.2 sec.
Veteran LukÃ¡Å¡ Bauer of the Czech Republic, attempting to win a third consecutive 15 km medal in his fifth Olympic Games, ultimately finished fifth, about 20 seconds out of the medals and almost one minute behind Cologna. Only three months after undergoing an ankle operation Cologna comfortably won his second gold medal in Sochi, defending his 15 km freestyle gold medal from Vancouver, this time in the classical style.
At the end of the race, Cologna waited until the final finisher, Roberto CarcelÃ©n of Peru, came across the line almost 38 minutes later, supporting his efforts by greeting him and congratulating him for finishing, despite competing with broken ribs sustained only a few days before. For this gesture, in 2015 Cologna was given the IOC President Trophy for Sportsmanship at a ceremony in Lausanne.

In a superior manner, he secured the gold medal at the Guyangshu ski and biathlon center in Zhangjiakou, ahead of Aleksandr Bolshunov (ROC), with the Norwegian Johannes HÃ¸sflot KlÃ¦bo taking bronze.
Niskanen, whose sister Kerttu missed out on gold in a heartbeat final against Therese Johaug the previous day, never left any doubts about his victory. Each of the three intermediate times saw him in first place. At the finish line, he was 23.2 seconds ahead of Bolshunov and, after the team sprint in 2014 and the 50-kilometer race in 2018, won Olympic gold for the third time.
Bolshunov was in second place at the halfway mark, 11.4 seconds slower than Niskanen. KlÃ¦bo was 37.5 seconds behind at the finish, having come back from 20th place at the first intermediate time. After his poor showing in the skiathlon (40th), the 2018 three-time Olympic champion was much stronger and was happy about taking bronze. Known for his prowess in sprint competitions, he showed that he could contend in distance events as well.
Ilya Semikov (ROC) and PÃ¥l Golberg (Norway), were amongst the top three for part of the race, but eventually fell back to ninth and 11th place respectively

Nine starters later, her teammate, Olga Danilova, started slowly, but was second at 8.5 km, and then had the fastest finish to win a surprising gold medal, beating Lazutina by 5.6 seconds. Norway Anita Moen-Guidon was leading at the 1.8 km split, but fell back to fourth midway through, only to finish strongly and win the bronze medal. Moen-Guidon would return to the Winter Olympics in 2002, competing in the new sprint event, and win another bronze medal. She also won relay silvers in 1994, 1998, and 2002.

The event had been held twice at the World Championships, won in 1989 by Marjo Matikainen and in 1991 by Yelena VÃ¤lbe, who would win again in 1993. But in 1992 this race was dominated by Lyubov Yegorova. She posted the fastest time at each checkpoint, the fastest intermediate split, the fastest final split, and won the gold medal by 1:09.1 over Finland Marjut Lukkarinen. Lukkarinen was only fifth at the first and second time checks, but finished strongly for the silver medal. VÃ¤lbe had started well, was second at 1.9 km, but dropped to fourth at 7.7 km, trailing Yegorovoa, Matikainen, and Stefania Belmondo, but VÃ¤lbe finished quickly to move onto the podium.
This was Yegorova first Olympic medal, but she would win three golds and medal in every event in Albertville, and would return in 1994 to win three more golds and four medals at Lillehammer. Four days later Lukkarinen would win gold in the 5 km. VÃ¤lbe might be considered the greatest ever female cross-country skier. She competed in three Winter Olympics (1992, 1994, 1998), and won seven Olympic medals with three golds, but never an individual gold. In Albertville she won a bronze in all four individual events, but added a gold in the relay. But at the World Championships and World Cup, she was unparalleled among women. She won 17 World Championship medals, including 14 golds, and in 1997, VÃ¤lbe won gold medals in all five events on the schedule.

This likely left LukÃ¡Å¡ Bauer (CZE) as the favorite. Bauer was leading the 2009-10 World Cup, had won the distance and overall World Cup in 2007-08, and was runner-up to Veerpalu in the 15 km at the 2009 Worlds. With skiers setting off at 30 second intervals, Maurice Manificat (FRA) took an early lead in the competition, leading at the first two intermediate markers, and would eventually finish sixth with a time of 34:27.4. Pietro Piller Cottrer (ITA), who had won the test event at the course some 12 months earlier, had been quoted as saying that the course was too easy, and as he skied into a lead with a time of 34:00.9, it looked as though he may win gold. However, out on the course Dario Cologna (SUI), who had won the 2009 Tour de Ski, was the leader at the final check point and took the lead with a time of 33:36.3, a time which would easily hold up for the gold medal, giving Switzerland its first ever gold in cross-country skiing. Bauer followed home in a time of 34:12.0 to take the bronze medal, narrowly defeating Marcus Hellner (SWE) who was always close to a medal spot on the course, but just faded at the end to finish 1.5 seconds behind Bauer.

While the Norwegians dominated with a clean sweep in the first cross-country event, the 30 km skiathlon, the gold medalist Simen Hegstad KrÃ¼ger, had to settle for second place in the 15 km. The other two Norwegian medalists in the skiathlon, Martin Johnsrud Sundby and Hans Christer Holund went home empty handed after placing fourth and sixth, respectively, in the 15 km.
At these Games, the 15 km event was the only men cross-country event in which skiers started at 30 second intervals, and was, this time, run in the freestyle technique. After a cautious start, Cologna took the lead at the 6.0 km mark and remained in the lead until the end of the race. He gradually extended his margin to 18.3 sec at the finish line. A fierce struggle for the silver and bronze medals took place behind him. In the first phase of the race, French veteran Maurice Manificat set the fastest pace, holding on to second place until the 9.8 km mark, but eventually dropped to fifth place. Also, Holund and Sundby were in the top three at different stages of the race. But the actual medal winners KrÃ¼ger and Russian newcomer, and dark horse, Denis Spitsov, came from behind. KrÃ¼ger was amongst the leading three for the first time at the 9.8 km mark while Spitsov was still in fifth place at the last split time at 13.5 km. After competing just one World Cup season, the Russian bronze medal was quite a remarkable achievement, although he had won an Under-23 World title earlier in the year.
The first finisher on the leader board was Switzerland Roman Furger, setting the mark as an early starter with number 20, before eventually ending up on 12th place. Due to the sequence of the numbers, Spitsov later clocked the fastest time, but within minutes, was out-performed by KrÃ¼ger and Cologna. The latter was one of the favorites at the start and had the advantage of being in control of the race and also being aware of the split times of his opponents.
Norway top man for the short distances, and already decorated with the gold in the sprint, Johannes HÃ¸sflot KlÃ¦bo was not in this race. He was given a break in view of the prestigious relay scheduled for two days after the 15 km. Depression spread among the Swedish cross-country skiers after suffering another bitter defeat. They didnât come anywhere near the medals, with their best runner, Marcus Hellner doing no better than eighth. There was disappointment also for the 2017 50 km world champion, Canada Alex Harvey who, after another good race, could only finish seventh, 35 seconds behind Cologna.

Di Centa would win five medals in all the cross-country events in Lillehammer, adding a gold in the 30 km to her victory in this event.

The 2001 World Champion was Norway Bente Skari-Martinsen, who had been the dominant female cross-country racer over the past five years. But she elected not to contest this race in Salt Lake City, which left the event open.
The early leader in the race was Russian Yuliya Chepalova, but by 9 km, Italy Stefania Belmondo, the 1999 World Champion in the event, moved ahead, until her pole broke at 10.5 km. She dropped back to 10th place, but fortunately trailed the leader, Larisa Lazutina, by only 10 seconds. Belmondo was given a pole by a French official but it was very long, so she struggled for over 500 metres until an Italian coach gave her one of her own poles. She then powered ahead, caught Lazutina and won a narrow victory by 1.8 seconds. Behind them, Czech skier KateÅina NeumannovÃ¡ came in for the bronze medal. But Lazutina would not keep her silver medal. After the pursuit race, held six days later, she was found to have tested positive for darpopoietin, an erythropoietin analogue, and was disqualified in late 2003. NeumannovÃ¡ was moved up to silver, and Chepalova would get the bronze. At the 2003 World Championships, the event was won by the woman who wasnât there, Bente Skari-Martinsen.

She prevented BjÃ¸rgen from winning her third consecutive gold medal in the skiathlon, and became the first Swede to win the Olympic title. On the last two kilometers, PÃ¤rmÃ¤koski outpaced Andersson for the bronze medal by 0.6 seconds. An excellent performance was also showed by the fifth placed Jessie Diggins of the USA and sixth placed von Siebenthal.

In 2002 it was contested as 5 km classical followed by 5 km freestyle pursuit, but in 2006 both distances were increased to 71/2 km. Also, while the event had previously been run with interval starts in the classical, it was now a mass start, a format that was first dÃ©buted internationally at the 2005 World Championships. The favorites were the gold and silver medalists from the 2005 World Championships, Russian Yuliya Chepalova and Norway Marit BjÃ¸rgen, along with the 2003 World Champion, Estonia Kristina Å migun. The leader after the classical section was Slovenian Petra MajdiÄ, but she was 13th in the freestyle pursuit, and placed 11th overall. The runner-up after classical was Å migun, with Czech KateÅina NeumannovÃ¡ in third, but the margin between them was only 0.7 seconds. They would post the two best freestyle times with Å migun edging out NeumannovÃ¡ for the gold medal by 1.9 seconds. The defending champion was Canada Beckie Scott, who took almost two years to win her gold medal because of drug disqualifications. She was seventh after classical, and briefly took the lead in the pursuit phase, but slowed near the end and placed sixth. The bronze medal went to  Russia Yevgeniya Medvedeva, whose only previous international podium had come at the 2005 World Championships in the relay.

The competitors skied 71/2 km using the classical technique, followed by a pit stop to change to shorter skis, and then skied 71/2 km freestyle. Following her first gold medal in the Sprint event, Norway Marit BjÃ¸rgen, a four-time World Champion, was full of confidence and was among the leaders from the start. Charlotte Kalla (SWE), winner of the 10 km event, had an unfortunate fall towards the end of the classical section, and didnât feature in the race thereafter. By the pit stop, seven skiers had broken away from the main field, led by Aino-Kaisa Saarinen of Finland, who had been third at the 2009 World Championships. The lead group was then whittled down to four as the event came to its climax â BjÃ¸rgen, Saarinen, 2009 World Champion Justyna Kowalczyk (POL), and the runner-up at the 2009 Worlds, Kristin StÃ¸rmer Steira (NOR). Going into the home straight BjÃ¸rgen had a comfortable lead, and took her second gold medal of the 2010 Winter Olympics. The contest for the remaining medals was much closer, with Anna Haag (SWE) taking the silver medal less than one second ahead of Kowalczyk, who won the bronze medal by the length of her foot, just defeating StÃ¸rmer Steira, the official difference being 0.1 seconds. Defending gold medalist Kristina Å migun-VÃ¤hi (EST) started the race, but did not finish. For StÃ¸rmer Steira, this was her fourth fourth-place finish at the Olympics, after three fourths and a fifth in 2006. She would later win gold in Vancouver with the relay.

In the skiathlon, the Norwegian convincingly finished the 15 kilometers (7.5 km in classic technique and 7.5 km in freestyle) in 44:13.7. World Cup leader Nataliya Nepryayeva from Russia (+30.2 seconds) won silver, and bronze went to Austria Teresa Stadlober (+30.5).
After the classical section, Kerttu Niskanen and Frida Karlsson were both on Johaug heels, just a few seconds behind. Although the American Jessie Diggins was the fastest in the freestyle section, she was already too far behind to come close to a medal. Johaug continued to extend her lead for the remainder of the race. Nepryayeva and Stadlober, who skied with consistent pace in both styles, outdistanced Niskanen and Karlsson on the last few km after a fierce four-way battle on the second part.
For Johaug, it was her second Olympic victory, twelve years after relay gold at Vancouver in 2010. The three-time world champion in skiathlon (2015, 2019, and 2021) missed the 2018 Winter Games in PyeongChang due to a doping ban. For Stadlober, the medal served as redemption after she missed out on a podium place in the 30km at PyeongChang 2018, after taking a wrong turn when well placed, and ultimately finished ninth.
Yilamujiang Dinigeer was 43rd for China. The Uyghur lit the Olympic flame at the opening ceremony. Her election by the Chinese leadership had caused a lot of criticism.

His great rival from the 1980 games, Juha Mieto, who lost to Wassberg in 1980 by the closest possible margin, one one hundredth of a second, was present. The Finnish veteran, now 34, was still hoping for an Olympic gold medal. Another Finn, Harri Kirvesniemi, was in the lead after 5.8 km, six seconds ahead of the new 22-year-old Swedish cross-country star Gunde Svan. The Finns were doing well, Aki Karvonen in third position, only two seconds behind Svan, and Mieto followed in fourth place, ahead of the 30 km winner Nikolay Zimyatov. At the next intermediate checkpoint, Svan had taken over the lead, but it was very close. Kirvesniemi was in second and Karvonen in third place, only five and seven seconds behind the leader. Mieto was still fourth, 20 seconds behind. Zimyatov had slowed down to eighth, 50 seconds behind the young Swedish leader. In the final stages of the race Svan skied brilliantly, maintaining the Swedish tradition and secured his country sixth Olympic gold medal at the distance. Karvonen finished stronger than Kirvesniemi and was rewarded with the silver medal, Mieto once again missed the podium in fourth place. The Norwegian Ove Aunli finished with the fifth best time, but was disqualified for using skating strokes over the last 200 m.
In 1984, Gunde Svan was at the dawn of a great career which would last for seven more seasons. He remains, thru 2009, the youngest male Olympic cross-country champion of all time, being 22 years, 1 month and 1 day old when he won the 1984 15 km race. Closest to him is Thomas  Alsgaard from Norway, who won the 1994 30 km race when he was 22 years, 1 month and 4 days old.

The Finns, who had taken all the medals at the 1954 World Championships with Veikko Hakulinen winning, was favored among most of the experts. But the defending champion from 1952, Hallgeir Brenden of Norway, was eager to revenge his disappointing 14th place in the 30 km. His form prior to Cortina had been in flux â at times he looked superb but a toe injury in December had slowed him and he had not won any of the Norwegian selection races. The Soviet skiers were considered better on the longer distances.
On a foggy and snowy day, Brenden starting first among the favourites, and took the lead after 5 km., 13 seconds ahead of Vladimir Kuzin with Sixten Jernberg one second behind Kuzin. Hakulinen was seventh, 25 seconds behind. During the following 5 km., Brenden increased his lead. At 10 km. he was 21 seconds ahead of Pavel Kolchin, who had advanced from fourth place at 5 km. Jernberg, still in contention for a medal, was nine seconds behind Kolchin, but Kuzin was obviously in trouble, falling back to fourth place.
At the finish, Soviet skier Nikolay Anikin, who started 18th, had the best time until Martin Stokken was able to take the lead. Brenden was able to keep his speed and finished with a time over one minute better than Stokken. Kolchin was able to stay ahead of Hakulinen and was in silver medal position, but Jernberg with his late start number of 56, had a good finish and secured his second silver medal, three seconds better than Kolchin.
Hallgeir Brenden, a 26-year-old lumberjack from Trysil, had defended his title, the first cross-country skier to do this at the Olympics. He was an outspoken and extremely popular man, and the picture of him with Italian movie star Sophia Loren on his knee went all over the world and contributed to his rising international fame.

In his place was another unknown Soviet skier, 21-year old Yevgeny Belyayev. The defending Olympic Champion Sven-Ãke LundbÃ¤ck was on the Swedish team, and the last World Champion on wooden skis, the 15 km gold medalist from the 1974 World Championships, Norwegian Magne Myrmo, was also among the 80 competitors, but none of them had shown signs of their former brilliance during the Olympic season. The Soviets were highly favored, and the Nordic hopes were the consistent Finn Juha  Mieto and the Norwegian Ivar Formo, 1972 Olympic bronze medalist at the distance.
To everyone surprise, at 5 km, Arto Koivisto was in the lead, three seconds ahead of the Soviet Union  Nikolay Bazhukov with his teammate Belyayev another three seconds behind. Another Soviet skier, Ivan Garanin, was in fourth place, and the first four had taken a clear lead over the rest of the field. At 10 km, Bazhukov had taken over the lead, four seconds ahead of Koivisto, with Belyayev third 14 seconds behind and Garanin still fourth. Formo was a distant fifth, almost 40 seconds behind Garanin. Inspired by his team leaders, Koivisto now tried hard to catch Bazhukov. Five kilometers from home they were equal, but then, in a downhill part of the track, Koivisto had to throw himself down to avoid a collision with a tourist who had found his way onto the Olympic track. He lost a lot of time, and Bazhukov finished 2.7 seconds ahead of the fast-finishing Belyayev, with Koivisto able to secure the bronze medal, 21 seconds behind the winner. Only Belyayev had a faster finish than the young American Bill Koch, who was in 15th place after 5 km, 12th after 10 km, advancing to sixth at the finish, only three seconds behind Formo, proving that his silver medal in the 30 km race three days earlier was certainly not just a stroke of good fortune. Defending champion LundbÃ¤ck ended in 30th place, and the World Champion on wooden skis from 1974, Magne Myrmo, was a distant 55th, five and a half minutes behind the winner.
The new Olympic Champion was only 22, and born in a village by the Pechora River in the Komi Republic in Northwest Russia. His first international appearance was the 1975 Holmenkollen 15 km race, ending in a modest 32nd place, 21/2 minutes behind the winner Juha Mieto.

The two main roles in the drama were played by a young Swede, Thomas Wassberg, and a Finnish veteran with an impressive collection of silver medals from international championships, the big Juha Mieto, 197 cm tall and weighing around 100 kg. Wassberg started last of the 63 participants, half a minute behind the best Norwegian, Ove Aunli. Mieto, wearing start number 54, started half a minute behind the reigning world champion at the distance, the Pole JÃ³zef Åuszczek.
Wassberg started fast, and at the 5 km mark he had caught Aunli and was in the lead, three seconds ahead of Mieto. Åuszczek also had a strong opener, only ten seconds behind the leader, closely followed by a real surprise, the 19-year old West German Jochem Behle and the 30 km winner Nikolay Zimyatov. At 10 km Wassberg had increased his lead to 4.8 seconds. Mieto, still in second place, had almost caught Åuszczek, starting half a minute in front of him, but the Pole was still in third place, now 30 seconds behind the leader. Yevgeny Belyayev had advanced from 11th to fourth., and his teammate Zimyatov was down in sixth place. Aunli had been able to adjust his speed and was on Wassberg heels, advancing from 13th to fifth place. Only two seconds separated the four skiers behind Wassberg and Mieto 5 km from home. Young Behle had dropped down to ninth and was out of contention for the medals.
First of the favorites to finish was Zimyatov, looking very fresh at the finish and beating Belyayev final time by 12 seconds. But Mieto finished even faster. The Finn had passed Åuszczek, quickly left the Pole behind, and crossed the finish line in 41:57.64, beating Zimyatov time by 36 seconds. Could Wassberg respond to Mieto finish? The Swede, still skiing together with Aunli, was told 500 m from home that he had a one second lead over Mieto, and, fighting desperately, crossed the finish line in 41:57.63. He had won by the closest possible margin, one hundredth of a second! Aunli secured the bronze medal for Norway, beating Zimyatov by 5 seconds.
Wassberg, then 23, had made his Olympic dÃ©but in 1976 as a teenager. Before the 1978 World Championships, he was severely injured in a car accident, but fought his way back to the international elite by hard and determined work. Mieto, starting in his third Olympics, ended his career with three individual silver medals in international championships, his 1976 Olympics relay gold medal his only championship victory. In 2007, this extremely popular athlete, who had six wins at Holmenkollen from 1973-1978, was elected a member of the Finnish parliament. At the 1972 Olympics he was involved in another close duel, losing the bronze medal by a margin of 0.06 seconds in the 15 km race. Wassberg proposed to Mieto that they could cut their medals in two parts and then melt them together as a mixed gold-silver medal. Mieto politely thanked him, but said no to the idea, and ended the 1980 season by winning the cross-country World Cup for the second time in a row. The International Skiing Federation (FIS) decided shortly after the 1980 Olympics that all times in cross-country races would henceforth be rounded to the nearest tenth of a second.

The popular Norwegian, nicknamed âLang-Haraldâ due to his height of 191 cm, unusual among cross country skiers, could at last claim a gold medal as a member of Norway winning relay team at the 1966 World Championships. The 15 km race developed into a fierce duel between the Finnish defending champion and his Norwegian rival GrÃ¸nningen, a strawberry farmer from Lensvik in TrÃ¸ndelag. Now aged 33 and starting in his third and last Olympics, GrÃ¸nningen was wearing start number 5 out of 75 competitors. He chose to start at top speed, and at 4 km he had already overtaken the four skiers starting ahead of him. At 5 km he was in the lead, nine seconds ahead of MÃ¤ntyranta with the silver medalist from the 30 km race, Odd Martinsen in third, only half a second behind the Finn. The Olympic Champion from the 30 km race three days earlier, Franco Nones, was totally out of contention in a distant 36th place. MÃ¤ntyranta was able to turn the tables at the 10 km checkpoint, taking the lead 10 seconds ahead of GrÃ¸nningen. Kalevi Laurila had advanced from 5th to 3rd, only 5 seconds behind GrÃ¸nningen. But the Norwegian veteran fought bravely in the final stages of the race. One and a half kilometers from the finish MÃ¤ntyranta was still 7 seconds ahead, but as in the 30 km race he had used most of his strength in the middle part of the race.  He finished 1.9 seconds behind his Norwegian rival, and GrÃ¸nningen could finally claim an individual gold medal. Behind the two rivals there was a close struggle for the bronze medal. The Swede Gunnar Larsson advanced from 8th place at 5 km to 6th place at 10 km, and a strong finish earned him the bronze medal, four seconds ahead of Laurila, who like MÃ¤ntyranta faded over the last 5 km.

At 5 km he was in the lead, nine seconds ahead of East German Gert-Dietmar Klause, who eventually faded to 13th place. At 10 km, LundbÃ¤ck had increased his lead to half-a-minute, and he would finish in superb style, his winning margin being almost 32 seconds. The struggle for the other medals developed into a fierce fight between five men. Yury Skobov, a 22-year old Soviet skier, was in second place at 10 km, 2.5 seconds ahead of another youngster, the 20-year-old Norwegian Ivar Formo. Under a second behind Formo was a young Finn, Juha Mieto, also aged 22, while lying fifth, only fifth seconds behind Mieto, was another Soviet athlete, Fyodor Simashov.

But Simashev had the strongest finish of all and bettered Formo time by 1.9 seconds. After LundbÃ¤ck had finished his gold medal race, only Mieto among the last starters could do something regarding the distribution of the medals.

But the recent 30 km Olympic Champion, Eero MÃ¤ntyranta was also considered the top favorite in this event.

In the world Championships in Lahti, Finland in 1958, they came home with no medals, their best individual placing was fifth in the 15 km race, achieved by HÃ¥kon Brusveen.
At the first Norwegian selection races Brusveen was not at his best, but showed better form in the last race when placing fourth in the Norwegian Championships in 15km, only 11 seconds behind the winner Brenden. The Norwegian Olympic Committee selected seven cross country skiers for Squaw Valley. Brusveen was appointed as a substitute who should stay at home in Norway, to Brusveen great disappointment and loud protests in the Norwegian media.  An extra selection race over 12 km was decided, only two days before the team should leave for Squaw Valley. Brusveen showed superior form and won, over 40 seconds ahead of double Olympic champion Hallgeir Brenden. The sports enthusiast King Olav V told the NOC that he would like to see Brusveen in the Olympics, and the decision was changed. Brusveen, aged 33, and having already decided that 1960 would be his last season, travelled to the US one the day after the main team had left Oslo.
The 15 km race took place four days after the 30 km race, which ended with another disappointment for the Norwegians, Brenden as their best, placing only ninth. Brusveen was then selected for the 15km team, starting with number 20 out of 54 competitors. After 5 km it looked to be another great day for Sweden. Janne Stefansson was in the lead, three seconds ahead of Sixten Jernberg, with Rolf RÃ¤mgÃ¥rd another four seconds behind. It was very close, Gennady Vaganov following only one second behind RÃ¤mgÃ¥rd, and with Brusveen in sixth place, still in contention for a medal, 17 seconds behind the leader.  At 10 km things had changed. Jernberg was now in the lead, but only two seconds ahead of fast charging Brusveen and Veikko Hakulinen, the Finn showing better form than in the 30 km. Stefansson was down in fourth place, 16 seconds behind.
The final stage of the race developed into a real thriller. Brusveen was first to finish of the medal favorites. He finished his race in excellent style and bettered Stefansson leading time by more than 50 seconds. Hakulinen could not respond to Brusveen finishing speed. The last challenger was Jernberg. The gold medalist from the 30 km race could not match Brusveen finish, but secured his sixth Olympic medal, only 3.1 seconds behind the overjoyed Olympic Champion Brusveen.
HÃ¥kon Brusveen was later to become an extremely popular radio commentator, for many years giving intermediate reports from out on the cross country track at national and international championships via a portable radio transmission set.

This was her third Olympics, having competed in cross-country in 1992 and both biathlon and cross-country in 1998, but she had yet to win an Olympic medal, despite also having won six individual World Championships between 1997-2001. The early lead was taken by Germany Andrea Henkel, well-known on the World Cup circuit, but who had never won a medal in a major international. Henkel missed only one shot, equal or better than all the leaders, and she finished in 47:29.1, which would be the fifth fastest ski time. No one challenged her time until Norway Liv Grete Skjelbreid-PoirÃ©e started 56th. The wife of France biathlon star RaphaÃ«l PoirÃ©e also missed only one target and came in less than eight seconds behind Henkel. Forsberg started 65th, and posted the third fastest ski time, but her two missed targets brought her home in third place, 39.2 seconds behind Henkel. Henkel gold medal was somewhat surprising but over the next six years, she would win four individual World Championships and the 2006-07 World Cup.

These times were enough for Berger and Khrustaleva the gold and silver medal respectively. Eventually coming through to take the bronze medal was Darya Domracheva of Belarus who finished comfortably in bronze medal position. Berger win meant that Norway became the first nation to win 100 gold medals in the Winter Olympics. The fastest skiing time again belonged to Magdalena Neuner but this time the German returned to her more erratic shooting form and missed three targets. Two notable absentees were the Russian pair of multiple world and Olympic medallist Albina Akhatova and 2008 world champion Ekaterina Iourieva. Both were banned for their part in a doping scandal.

Silver went to AnaÃ¯s Chevalier-Bouchet from France (+9.4 seconds), and bronze was won by Norway Marte Olsbu RÃ¸iseland (+15.3).
With good wind conditions, the victory was decided by the performance on the shooting range and a perfect pacing on the difficult course. Herrmann, who had won a cross-country skiing medal at the 2014 Winter Games, had a reputation as a fast skier who was less stable on the shooting range. This event is frequently decided by the shooting, as one minute is added to the running time for every miss at the range. In the third round of shooting she missed the first target, but she was not discouraged and had a clean last shooting round, and a strong final round earned her the gold. It was Herrmann first Olympic medal in biathlon after one gold, three silver and one bronze at World Championships.
Chevalier-Bouchet also conceded just one penalty minute, but was about 10 seconds slower on the course. Top favourite Marte Olsbu RÃ¸iseland missed two targets and was not able to make up for the additional minute, although she was clearly the fastest skier. The best running time was achieved by 2021 World Cup winner Tiril Eckhoff. Five penalty minutes, however, brought her down to 22nd place. Ukraine Iryna Petrenko hit all 20 targets, but her skiing time was only good enough for an 11th place finish. A major surprise was Germany Vanessa Voigt in her first World Cup season. Her fourth place was a career-high in an individual event.

But the Finns and Norwegians slowly began to regain their former strength. In 1951 the Finns fought bravely against the Swedes in Holmenkollen, Paavo Lonkila winning and Eero Kolehmainen finishing third. Norway best card seemed to be the 23-year-old Hallgeir Brenden, who won his first national championships 1951 and impressed to win both the 18 km. and 30 km. at the national championship in January 1952, just before the opening of the Oslo Games.
The event was hold under excellent snow conditions, and at the halfway point the Finn Tapio MÃ¤kelÃ¤ was in the lead, 10 seconds ahead of Lonkila, Brenden and Nils Karlsson, and another 5 seconds down to Norwegian Martin Stokken, and the favorite in Nordic Combined, Heikki Hasu. Stokken, the 19th starter, took an early lead, but a few minutes later MÃ¤kelÃ¤ finished 49 seconds faster. Spurred on by an enthusiastic home crowd, Brenden finished his race with excellent speed and bettered MÃ¤kelÃ¤ time by 35 seconds. The home crowd then waited nervously for Lonkila and Hasu. The two Finns could not match Brenden finishing speed, and it ended with a close battle for the bronze medal, Lonkila finishing four seconds ahead of Hasu. The Swedes had a disappointing day. Karlsson faded to fifth place in the last part of the race, his team-mates placing seventh, ninth, and 13th, far below expectations. Brenden had secured Norway first cross country gold since 1928 in only his third real season as a competitive skiier.
Both Stokken and Brenden were also excellent track athletes, Stokken finishing fourth in the 10000 m at the London Games in 1948. He ended his track career after the 1952 Helsinki Olympics having won 19 national titles in long-distance and cross-country running to fully concentrate on cross-country skiing.  Brenden was the first Norwegian to break the 9-minute barrier in the 3000 metre steeplechase and was twice national champion in that event.

Before the start of the race there was a big discussion about the status of the participants in Nordic Combined, starting in the same race. At the end it was decided that the same athlete could participate both in 18 km and Nordic Combined.
Norway then decided to enter Thorleif Haug and Johan GrÃ¸ttumsbraaten in both events, Jon MÃ¥rdalen and Einar Landvik only for the 18 km, and Thoralf StrÃ¸mstad and Harald Ãkern only for the Nordic Combined. 17 of the 30 participants in Nordic combined were entered for both events. One of the competitors entered for 18 km only, Landvik, could certainly have taken a medal in Nordic combined. He placed 5th in both the 18 km and the Ski Jumping, but there was no place for him in the Norwegian team for Nordic Combined!
In those days no intermediate times were taken during the race, and for some time it looked like a Finnish day.

During the war Swedish skiers had developed new training methods to increase their stamina, and changed their technique, giving more importance to the diagonal style. They had also developed a new type of ski wax, the famous brand Swix. At the Holmenkollen competition in 1947, Nils Karlsson won the 18 km. race, followed by three countrymen and two Finns, with the best Norwegian placing seventh, almost four minutes behind the winner.
Karlsson was regarded as the favorite, but after a fast opening section he struggled with the thin air and finished in fifth place, last among the Swedes, save for the Nordic combined entrants. Martin LundstrÃ¶m, a 29-year old from UmeÃ¥, had his international breakthrough and won comfortably ahead of Nils Ãstensson and Gunnar Eriksson. The winner of the Nordic Combined, Heikki Hasu (FIN), was the only skier able to split the Swedish quartet, beating Karlsson by 11 seconds for fourth place. For the Norwegians, the event was a great disappointment. Their best skier, Olav Hagen, came in ninth, beaten by LundstrÃ¶m by over five minutes.
Before 1948, LundstrÃ¶m had been unable to win a Swedish Championship, but this was his great year. Later in the season he won the Holmenkollen 18 km. race followed by four more Swedes, and he would also claim three Swedish titles â 18 km., 30 km. and as a member of his club relay team.

This change in the program was certainly a much better solution for those skiers competing in both events.
The 18 km. race presented a strong field of merited skiers, all of them at their competitive peak. In Norway team Johan GrÃ¸ttumsbraaten, the defending champion now aged 32, had shown new proof of his championship abilities by winning the World Championships at 18 km. in Oberhof, Germany 1931. Arne Rustadstuen was world champion on the distance in 1930, and Ole Stenen was World Champion in 50 km. from 1931 and had won the prestigious Holmenkollen the same year. Finland top skiers were Veli Saarinen, world champion at 18 km. in 1929 and Martti Lappalainen, winner in Holmenkollen 1928. Sweden Sven UtterstrÃ¶m, now 30, had much cause for revenge after being ill during the 1928 Games. He was considered to be a 50 km. specialist, winning the World Championship 1930 and Holmenkollen in 1929 and 1930 over that distance.
The evening before the start of the race the weather was perfect for cross country skiing. But the next morning the temperature was rising, and that created problems preparing the skis for optimal gliding. In earlier competitions with mild weather the Swedes had shown great ability to choose the right ski-wax, and so they did this time. At an early stage of the race it was clear that this would be a great day for Sweden. UtterstrÃ¶m commanded the race from start to finish, and won by a margin of exactly 2 minutes. The 24-year old Swede Axel WikstrÃ¶m surprised the experts by winning the silver medal 17 seconds ahead of Saarinen in 3rd place. Lappalainen was 4th, and the favored Norwegians were not satisfied with 5th and 6th place for Rustadstuen and GrÃ¸ttumsbraaten, four minutes behind the winner.

Nine of the 49 starting skiers were also entered for the Nordic Combined event, among them the great Norwegian all-rounder Johan GrÃ¸ttumsbraaten. Four years earlier he was overshadowed by his countryman Thorleif Haug and had to be content with one silver and two bronze medals, but in 1926 he was the first World Champion in Nordic Combined.
The weather had changed again. Now the fÃ¶hn was over, and the temperature was stable around -7Â° C. The track was icy and fast with a height difference of 400 m, demanding great technical skills from the skiers.
At the halfway point GrÃ¸ttumsbraaten had a commanding lead over Ole Hegge, the only competitor from the 50 km. event who was able to fight for a medal, and the Finn Martti Lappalainen. In the last part of the race the Norwegian quartet dominated the race, but a strong finish by the best of the Finns, Veli Saarinen, prevented the Norwegians from taking the first four places.
GrÃ¸ttumsbraaten won his first gold, Hegge was second and Reidar ÃdegÃ¥rd from Lillehammer came in third.

The Scandinavian skiers were still dominating, taking the first nine places. Czechoslovakia had the best Middle European team with their best skiers in 10th and 11th place.
Ole Hegge, originating from the TromsÃ¸ area far behind the Artic Circle, was the first Olympic medallist from the Arctic Region and an extremely talented skier. He was raised in a poor farming family, became a big local hero but had the habit of almost always coming in second place in important meetings, he did it three times in the Holmenkollen 50 km.

The conditions were excellent, temperatures varying from â 2 to â 5 C.Â° around the course, which had an elevation change of 275 meters. The highly favored Scandinavian teams had made minor changes from their relay quartets. Most surprising perhaps, Finland had put Pekka Niemi onto the team instead of Klaes Karppinen, World Champion in the event in 1935. The Norwegians had entered the 1930 world champion Arne Rustadstuen instead of Sverre Brodahl, who had to be content with starting âonlyâ in the Nordic combined. OddbjÃ¸rn Hagen and Olaf Hoffsbakken were entered for both events.
Of the early starters, LukÃ¡Å¡Â·MihalÃ¡k from Czechoslovakia was the first skier to beat 1-20 at the finish, and he was in the lead until Norway double world champion in Nordic Combined from 1934 and 1935, OddbjÃ¸rn Hagen, reached the finishing line in a time almost 3 and a half minutes faster. Neither Finland World Champion, Sulo Nurmela, nor the Swede, Martin Matsbo, could match Hagen, Matsbo finishing 1:29 behind. But the Swede Erik Larsson, nicknamed âKiruna-Lasseâ (he was a miner from Kiruna in Swedish Lapland), made the race of his life. Starting half a minute behind Rustadstuen, he caught the Norwegian early and pushed ahead mercilessly, beating Hagen leading time by 55 seconds. Of the late starters, Niemi was able to beat Matsbo by a scant margin and secure a bronze medal for Finland. The hero from the relay race Kalle Jalkanen, starting next to last wearing start number 111, had a bad day and could only finish in a disappointing 12th place, beaten by the Swedish Olympic champion by almost five minutes.
Larsson, only aged 23 when we won his Olympic gold, was born in a poor family in the Finnish speaking village of Kurravarra, 12 km. north-east of the mining town Kiruna.  Shortly after his Olympic gold, he ended his sport career, donating his prizes and Olympic medals to his local congregation, and became a leading Laestadian Christian preacher in Kiruna. His granddaughter Ãsa Larsson became one of Sweden most well-known crime fiction authors.  Bronze medalist Niemi, born in Finnish Lapland, had a great year in 1937 when he was 50 km. World Championship.  In 1938 he also won the prestigious Holmenkollen over the same distance.

Norway had won the event at the past three World Championships, and their four team members, Ole Einar BjÃ¸rndalen, Emil Hegle Svendsen, Tora Berger, and Tiril Eckhoff had already won individual biathlon medals in Sochi. With the team victory, BjÃ¸rndalen collected his 13th Olympic medal, setting a new Winter Olympic record for the most medals ever won, surpassing his former teammate, cross-country skiier BjÃ¸rn DÃ¦hlie. Norway was almost perfect in its shooting, as only Berger, on the opening leg, missed any shots, and with her extra shots, she cleaned up those misses. Eckhoff dropped back to second on her leg, as the Czech Republic Gabriela SoukalovÃ¡ put her team ahead, but BjÃ¸rndalen gave Norway a lead they never relinquished, as he handed Svendsen a 43.1 second margin for his anchor leg, which became an effective victory lap. The Czech Republic held on for second with Italy taking a surprising bronze medal.
Germany, who originally placed fourth, was disqualified after Evi Sachenbacher-Stehle failed a drug test. On 1 December 2017 Olga Zaytseva and Olga Vilukhina were disqualified after findings of the Oswald Commission into Russian doping at Sochi 2014. Both appealed their disqualification. Zaytseva disqualification was upheld, while Vilukhina was reinstated. However, because of Zaytseva disqualification, the Russian team was disqualified. They had originally placed fifth before the disqualification of Germany, and had moved up to fourth, so no medals were affected by any of the drug rulings in this event.

Previously it had been 2 x 6 km for the women and 2 x 7.5 km for the men. Gusty winds made the first event in biathlon at the 2022 Winter Games a turbulent affair. Nevertheless, the favourites eventually collected their medals with Norway winning gold ahead of France and the ROC in third.
The first team that fell victim to the conditions was Germany with rookie Vanessa Voigt. Although known as an excellent shooter, she started with two penalty rounds. Norway, with Marte Olsbu RÃ¸iseland, held the lead at the first exchange. Italy Dorothea Wierer was the best markswoman of the top teams on the second leg, finishing second in the second exchange behind France Julia Simon. This time, Norway Tiril Eckhoff went three penalty rounds and dropped back to fifth place.
The weather conditions improved when the men took over. Ãmilien Jacquelin had a brilliant start with a clean first round of shooting. At the standing shooting, however, it was his turn to suffer two extra penalty rounds. Aleksandr Loginov third leg brought the ROC from seventh to first at the last exchange, followed by Sweden, with France third. The United States were a surprise fourth, with Norway in fifth, but still only 21.9 seconds behind the leaders.
Eventually the skiing speed of Johannes Thingnes BÃ¸ and Quentin Fillon Maillet would decide the race. They closed in on ROC Eduard Latypov. A three-way battle ensued on the final lap, in which the Norwegians had the upper hand, with only 1.5 seconds separating the three top teams.
For Norway this was their third consecutive medal in the mixed relay, in what was the third edition of this event, having won gold in 2014, and silver in 2018. Tiril Eckhoff became the first biathlete to win three medals in the mixed relay, as she had been on each of those three teams.

Despite this, it was hard to pick a favorite, as not all nations had competed at full strength in the World Cups. China had won two of the four World Cup races in 2021/22, with Netherlands and ROC grabbing the other wins. In addition, Hungary had made the podium twice.
Just four of the 12 competing teams were eliminated in the quarter-finals, but notably among them was Republic of Korea, historically the most successful nation in short-track speed skating. More upsets came in the semi-finals, as the Netherlands crashed out in the first heat, at the hands of their star racer, Suzanne Schulting. The second heat saw both ROC and USA disqualified, after lengthy video reviews. Particularly the American dismissal, which favored the home Chinese team, was considered controversial.
Italy grabbed the early lead in the final, but China slipped ahead with a great maneuver by Ren Ziwei, followed by Canada. With slightly over six laps to go, Canada Florence Brunelle collided with ZsÃ³fia Konya of Hungary, for which Canada would later be penalized. This left China with a seemingly comfortable lead over Italy. But after the last exchange, Pietro Sighel closed the gap to Wu Dajing, even making an attempt to pip the Chinese at the finish line. It was just short of the gold, though, leaving China to win its first gold medal of the 2022 Olympic Winter Games.
Of note, the podium featured both a pair of brothers â the Liu of Hungary â as well as a pair of sisters â the Valcepina of Italy.

The favorite was the Irishman, John Daly, while the top American runner, Jim Lightbody, was contesting his first steeplechase.  After one lap, Daly led by 10 yards over Harvey Cohn, with Lightbody in second, another 10 yards back.  After two laps, Daly had opened up a 40-yard lead, and he still led going to the last lap, though the margin is given variously as either 15 or 60 yards.  At this point, Daly balked at the water jump, and must have virtually collapsed, for not only was he caught by Lightbody on the last lap, but Lightbody pulled away to win by about 100 yards.  Arthur Newton, who had never contended, finished third, another 30 yards behind Daly.
Jim Lightbody attended the University of Chicago and represented the Chicago AA.  Although he won three gold medals at the 1904 Olympics, he was relatively unknown prior to that time.

The silver went to Guatemalan Erick Barrondo, making this the first Olympic walk podium without a European, as Spain Miguel Ãngel LÃ³pez placed fifth.
Chen took the lead from the start, leading at the halfway point with Wang in 40:08, but Chen poured it on over the last 10K, negative splitting with a final 38:38, and what Track & Field News described as a withering final lap in 7:31. The leaders were quite young, with Chen winning the day before his 20th birthday, while Wang was 20, and Barrondo and Cai only 21-years-old. Barrondo medal was the first ever Olympic medal for Guatemala.
The Chinese walk improvement was credited to Sandro Damilano, their Italian coach and the brother of 3-time Olympic medalist Maurizio Damilano. He stressed technique to the Chinese, who had earlier been known for frequent disqualifications but had long overcome that. One major surprise in the 20K walk was the poor showing of the Russian walkers. Two-time World Champion Valeriy Borchin staggered off the course with less than two kilometres left, the victim of a warm day, and did not finish, although he had been second at the time, while Vladimir Kanaykin was disqualified, and Andrey Krivov placed only 37th.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected.
In January 2015 two Russians, Valeriy Borchin and Vladimir Kanaykin, were âdisqualifiedâ for biological passport offenses. Kanaykin had actually already been disqualified with three red cards, so effectively he was disqualified from having been disqualified, while Borchin, who did not finish in London, was thus disqualified from not finishing. In August 2017 the third Russian competitor, Andrey Krivov, who originally finished 37th, was also disqualified for a biological passport offense.
The three Russian walkers in the 50 km race were also all disqualified on re-testing. All Russians walkers were coached by Viktor Chegin, who was infamous for his athletes testing positive for PED usage, which more than 35 of them did between 2005-15. On 17 February 2016, Chegin was banned for life from athletics coaching by the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).

It was an individual variant of the military ski patrol competition, an official medal sport in 1924, and organized as a demonstration sport on several earlier Olympic occasions. The first World Championships were organized in Saalfelden, Austria in 1958 with Adolf Wiklund from Sweden as the first champion. One year later the Soviets took a double in Courmayeur, Italy, with Vladimir Melanin as winner and Dmitry Sokolov in second place.
The Olympic biathlon competition in 1960 was contested over 20 km with 20 shots fired over four different ranges: 200m, 250m, 150m and 100m. The first three series were fired from a prone position, the last standing. Each missed target gave a two minute penalty, which was added to the final time. In 1967 the penalty for each missed target was reduced from two to one minute. Also the weapon was different from the small board rifle in use nowadays. The biathletes at that time used a high-power center fire rifle, normally caliber 7,62 mm. The normal start interval in those days was two minutes, but due to very mild temperatures the intervals were reduced to one minute for the first Olympic event.
Before the final five standing shots, only three participants had been able to hit all 15 targets, and those three held the medal positions. Aleksandr Privalov from the Soviet Union had a lead of over two minutes on the Swede Klas Lestander, and the Norwegian 38-year-old veteran Henry Hermansen followed closely in third place. But the final standing shooting turned out to be decisive. Lestander once again made 5 hits, the only competitor to hit all 20 targets, and would finish as Olympic champion, even if his cross country time was the 15th best of the day out of 30 competitors. Privalov missed three times, was penalized with six minutes, and was also passed in the final stage by the Finn Antti TyrvÃ¤inen, who had two missed targets on the first two shooting phases, but was able to hit his last 10 targets. For Hermansen, the final shooting phase was even worse -  he missed four shots and went down to 10th place overall.
The fastest skier of the day, the French cross country specialist Victor Arbez, had a cross-country time almost 7 1/2 minutes better than the Olympic Champion Lestander, but was only able to hit 2 of his 20 targets. He was penalized 36 minutes and ended up placing 25th out of the 30 competitors.
The Olympic Champion Klas Lestander was 28, and came from the little village Arjeplog in the Lapland area in the far north of Sweden. He ended his athletic career after being a member of the Swedish relay team that placed third at the 1961 World Biathlon Championships. At that time, the relay event was not an official championships event.

The first of the favorites to go off was Norway Ole Einar BjÃ¸rndalen in the 26th slot. Just two days earlier, he had placed fifth in the 30 km cross-country race. He missed two targets but his skiing brought him home in an adjusted time of 51:03.3. His ski time of 49:03.3 would easily be the fastest of the event, and this performance would hold up for the gold medal. The silver medal went to Germany Frank Luck who was competing in his fourth Winter Olympics and had won the silver medal in the event in 1994. Luck had only the 14th fastest ski time but was clean in his shooting to win the silver. It was his fourth Olympic medal, added to two relay golds from 1994 and 1998.
For BjÃ¸rndalen, this was his third Olympics. He had won a gold in the sprint and silver in the relay in 1998, but Salt Lake City was his party. In the end, he would leave Utah with four gold medals, winning all three individual biathlon events, and leading Norway to the gold medal in the relay. Over the next decade BjÃ¸rndalen would confirm his status as the greatest ever biathlete, winning over 110 World Cup races, and 14 gold medals at the World Championships through 2009. At the 2005 and 2009 World Championships, he duplicated his Salt Lake City performance, sort of, winning gold medals in four events, although by then a fifth event, the mass start race, had been added to the program. BjÃ¸rndalen is married to Italian biathlete Nathalie Santer and his brother, Dag, also competed in the 1998 Olympic biathlon events.

The 30-year-old soldier from CSKA Kirov was World Champion in 1959, 1962 and 1963, and at the same championships he also was member of the Soviet Union team winning the team competition. His team-mate Aleksandr Privalov was also considered among the favorites, winning the bronze medal in the 1960 Games and coming second in the World Championships 1961. The greatest threats to the Soviets were considered to be the Finns. Antti TyrvÃ¤inen had a habit of coming second in international championships, with silver medals both from the 1960 games and from the World Championships 1962 and 1963. The Finnish team also consisted of two interesting veterans. Hannu Posti, aged 38 and placing fourth in 5000 m track at the 1952 Helsinki Games, had taken up biathlon with success, placing third at the 1963 World Championships. Another interesting start was triple Olympic Gold medalist in cross country skiing, Veikko Hakulinen. Now a veteran of 39, he was considered the fastest skier among the biathletes, and had a silver medal as a member of the Finnish team at the team competition in the World Biathlon Championships 1963.
After the first shooting VilmoÅ Gheorghe, a 23-year old Romanian representing Dinamo BraÅov, was in the lead, closely followed by Valentin Pshenitsyn, and with favorites Melanin and TyrvÃ¤inen close behind. At the second shooting Gheorghe had one missed target and received a 2 minutes penalty, and Melanin was in a clear lead, 1:10 ahead of Pshenitsyn. After the third shooting Melanin was still in the lead, now with Pshenitsyn only 36 seconds behind. The 24-year old Norwegian Olav Jordet had advanced to third, the Swede John GÃ¼ttke was fourth and Privalov fifth, all with no missed targets. At the final standing shooting, only Melanin among the top medal contenders was reported to have a full house. It was the first time that Melanin achieved 20 hits in a major competition. Privalov and Jordet were reported with one missed target, and the preliminary list showed a clear gold medal for Melanin, silver for Jordet and bronze for Privalov.
In those days the hits was not automatically registered, and the targets had to be taken down after the competition for a manual control. In the final control of the targets Privalov miss was changed to a hit, and he was advanced to the silver medal position ahead of Jordet. The Norwegian Ragnar Tveiten with the second fastest cross country time of the competition and preliminary placed eight with eight penalty minutes, had one of his missed targets changed to a hit and advanced to fourth position in the official results. Hakulinen was the fastest skier of the day, but with twelve penalty minutes he ended up as fifteenth in the final standings.

Medvedtsev went off 26th with Roetsch having start number 43. None of the leaders had clean shooting rounds, but Roetsch missed three targets to Medvedtsev two. However, it didnât matter because of Roetsch superior skiing speed, which brought him home for the gold medal in 56:33.3. As expected, Medvedtsev was second, finishing 21.3 seconds down to Roetsch.

Kirchner had the second fastest ski time, but his three penalty minutes dropped him to second behind Chepikov teammate, Yevgeny Redkin. And the question everyone was asking was, âWho is Yevgeny Redkin?â He was completely unknown, was not listed in the Soviet team book prior to Albertville, and did not find out he was starting until two days before the event began. Redkin would later compete for Belarus at the 1994 Winter Olympics, and he never again finished in the top 10 of any World Cup race, much less make a podium.

The World Champion of 1967, Viktor Mamatov, was considered the strongest Soviet contender for the gold medal. To the surprise of many Norwegian journalists, a 31-year-old newcomer on the international circuit, Magnar Solberg was given the last place on the Norwegian team, and former World Champion Olav Jordet became only a substitute.
The youngest member on the Soviet team, 21-year-old Aleksandr Tikhonov, was the first to start out of 60 competitors from 16 countries. The silver medalist of the 1967 World Championships, the 33-year-old Pole StanisÅaw Szczepaniak, was wearing start number two, and Magnar Solberg followed with start number three. Those three early starters should more or less dominate the event.
After the first round of shooting the Soviet Union Vladimir Gundartsev had a scant lead, only two seconds ahead of Solberg, with Nikolay Puzanov 42 seconds behind in third place, all of them with 5 hits. On the second shooting round both Solberg and Gundartsev continued with perfect shooting scores, but Solberg had built a one minute lead. Szczepaniak had advanced from seventh to third place, another minute behind. The third shooting session turned out to be decisive. Solberg once again was perfect, while both Gundartsev and Szczepaniak sustained one-minute penalties. Tikhonov, with two penalty minutes on his two first shooting rounds, was now in second place, over one and a half minutes behind, with Gundartsev another minute behind in third place. The last round of shooting brought no change among the medal candidates. Solberg made his fourth perfect shooting round, and would finish the race as a surprising gold medal winner, 55 second ahead of Tikhonov, the fastest skier of the day. Gundartsev secured the bronze medal half a minute ahead of Szczepaniak, but was 4:42 behind the gold medalist.
Magnar Solberg, a police officer from Trondheim, was an unexpected winner. He had never before done all perfect shooting rounds in a competition, and he had never even won a national championship. His only national championships was won four years later, just before his second Olympic appearance in the 1972 Sapporo Games. The silver medalist Aleksandr Tikhonov was at the start of an impressive international career which included three more Olympic appearances.

Of the other biathletes, Emil Hegle Svendsen set the pace with a time of 48:22.5, missing just one shot on the course.

For a long time it looked like the day for a long awaited individual Olympic gold medal for Tikhonov. He was in the lead after the first shooting round, 15 seconds ahead of Ikola, both with perfect shooting series. At the second round, Tikhonov had a one-minute penalty, but he still increased his lead over Ikola to 26 seconds, Kruglov now moving up to third place, 25 seconds behind the Finn. At the third round of shooting all three had perfect series, and Tikhonov increased his lead on Ikola to 1:02. The Finn now had Kruglov on his heels, only eight seconds behind, and the third Soviet competitor  Aleksandr Yelizarov had moved up to fourth, 26 seconds behind Kruglov. The three Soviets were clearly the fastest skiers of the day, and Ikola only chance seemed to have a perfect shooting result. As usual, the last shooting round turned out to be decisive. The first of the favorites to arrive was Kruglov, and with only one penalty minute he seemed sure of a medal. Next was Ikola. With a perfect round he could take the lead, but he was penalized two minutes, putting him in danger of missing the medals, now 1:24 behind Kruglov. Next to arrive was the leader Tikhonov, but he totally lost his nerves and was penalized six minutes, dropping down to seventh place, and out of the medal race. Yelizarov had a 2-minute penalty and was still behind Ikola, but now only by 19 seconds. Kruglov easily kept his lead to the finish and won by a comfortable margin. Ikola was able to stay in front of Yelizarov and secure the silver medal, 11 seconds ahead of his opponent. Italy  Willy Bertin finished strongly and advanced to fourth place at the finish, due to a perfect series at the two last shooting rounds. Tikhonov, having the fastest skiing time of the day, almost two minutes faster than Kruglov, was able to advance from seventh to fifth position from the last round of shots to the finish, but was very disappointed with the race, which for a long time, seemed to be a gold medal performance.

After his successful 1980 Winter Olympics (one gold and two silver medals), he was 1981 sprint and relay World Champion, 20 km and relay World Champion in 1982, and 20 km World Champion 1983, giving him a total of six individual and four relay World or Olympic gold medals. Still only 26, he was expected to increase his medal collection in the 1984 Olympics. But in 1983 his wife Sylvia died after a sudden illness, and Ullrich announced that he would retire from top sport. However, he was persuaded to return for another season and reluctantly agreed, but his preparations for the 1984 Olympics were surely affected by his wife death.
As usual, the 20 km race was the opening biathlon event in the 1984 Winter Olympics. After the first round of shooting, the new biathlon star from East Germany, 19-year old Frank-Peter Roetsch was in the lead. Roesch had won the silver medal behind Ullrich at the 1983 World Championship. In second place after the first shooting round was Peter Angerer of West Germany, who had won the bronze medal behind Roetsch at the 1983 World Championship. On the second series of shots, Roetsch was penalized two minutes and dropped down to sixth, putting Angerer in the lead. After the third shooting round the situation changed again. Jan MatouÅ¡, a 22-year old unmerited Czech, had taken over the lead, five seconds ahead of Angerer and Roetsch back in medal position in third. At the final set of targets the Norwegian Erik Kvalfoss, world sprint champion from 1982 and 1983, and the fastest skier of the day, took an early lead. MatouÅ¡ missed four targets and was out of the fight for medals. Then Roetsch missed one target, but was one minute ahead of Kvalfoss when he left for the final 2.5 km to the finish. Of the late starters, only Angerer was expected to compete with Roetsch time, and he did. After a perfect standing shooting round he was over a minute ahead of his East German competitor, and easily secured the first ever Olympic biathlon gold medal for West Germany. Roetsch had no problems taking the silver medal ahead of fast finishing Kvalfoss. Ullrich was far from his former self, usually one of the fastest skiers, he lost three minutes to Kvalfoss in skiing time and had to be content with fifth place, behind Frenchman Yvon Mougel, who improved from sixth in 1980 to fourth in 1984.

Soviet Aleksandr Tikhonov had been the dominant biathlete since his silver medal at the 1968 Winter Olympics, winning individual World Championships gold in 1969 and 1970, silver in 1971, and was also a member of the gold winning Soviet relay team all three years. Magnar Solberg, the surprise Olympic gold medalist from 1968, had won individual bronze medals in the World Championships in 1969 and 1971, and silver with the Norwegian relay team in 1969, 1970 and 1971. However, he still had no medals from Norwegian Championships, and the 35-year old policeman from Trondheim showed no signs of Olympic form at the start of the 1972 season, and was not, in fact, originally chosen for the Norwegian team. The selection committee agreed to give him an extra chance, and he again showed that he was made for big occasions.
After the first shooting round Solberg was in the lead with no misses, 22 seconds ahead of the Swede Lars-GÃ¶ran Arwidson, with Finland YrjÃ¶ Salpakari third, 10 seconds behind Arwidson. The favorite Tikhonov had three penalty minutes and was far behind. After the second shooting, Arwidson had taken a clear lead with a perfect round with the rifle. A big surprise was the 27-year-old Italian, Willy Bertin, who had started with one penalty minute, but now had a perfect round and climbed to second, 49 seconds behind Arwidson, and closely followed by Salkapari. Solberg had one penalty minute and dropped down to seventh place, 1:35 behind the leader.
After the third round of shooting the situation changed. Bertin had another perfect round and took over the lead, 32 seconds ahead of East Germany HansjÃ¶rg Knauthe, who had a one minute penalty from the first shooting round but since then had moved steadily up in the rankings. Salkapari was still in third, closely followed by Solberg, moving from seventh to fourth in spite of one additional penalty minute. Arwidson had two penalty minutes and dropped from first to fifth, but only 11 seconds behind the bronze position.
At the final shooting round, Bertin had four penalty minutes and was out of contention for a medal. Both Solberg, Knauthe, Arwidson and Salpakari had perfect shooting series, but Solberg was the fastest skiier and had a seven seconds lead over Knauthe. Arvidsson and Salpakari were 35 and 45 seconds behind, with no chances for gold. At the finish Solberg had extended his lead over Knauthe to 12 seconds and won his second Olympic gold medal, as dominant as he had been in 1968. Arwidson was able to defend his bronze medal position, ahead of fast finishing Tikhonov, who passed Salpakari in the final stages of the race. Finland Esko Saira was the fastest skier of the day, but had to be content with sixth place due to five penalty minutes. A few weeks after his second Olympic gold medal, Solberg was finally able to win a national championship gold medal, and after that he left top-sport to pursue a career as a police officer and criminal investigator.

The 27-year old Finn, nicknamed the âIron Maidenâ by the Norwegian press, started in a controlled way, lying third at 3.5 km, 6.6 seconds behind the leader, Smetanina, but only 0.1 seconds behind Brit Pettersen from Norway, who was second. But HÃ¤mÃ¤lainen soon took control of the race. At the halfway point, she was 13 seconds ahead of her Soviet rival, with Pettersen further behind but still in third place.

She had participated both in the 1976 and 1980 games without success, finishing 18th at 10 km in 1980 as her previous Olympic best. Now she was definitely the cross-country queen of the 1984 games. Later in 1984 she married her teammate Harri Kirvesniemi, and, under her new family name, participated in three more Winter Olympic Games, being the first woman to participate at six Winter Olympics.

Also entered was the German Max von Guilleaume, who had previously competed in equestrianism in the four-in-hand event. His yacht âClaraâ would have been the largest at 181 tons.
The official report of the Games and contemporary newspaper reports record only the owner, Quentin, but there were around 20 unknown crew aboard and Quentin regularly used master mariners to captain his yachts. Jesse Cranfield from the town of Rowhedge, Essex was Quentin regular captain in major competitions for many years either side of the Paris Olympics although it has not yet been possible to prove he sailed the boat at the Games.

Scott Goodman of Australia qualified fastest.
Pankratov tempered his enthusiasm in the final and swam a more conservative first half of the race. The Russian had a small lead over the second Australian in the race, Scott Miller, at the 100 metre mark but pulled out further ahead over the closing stages. As Miller, a 100 metres specialist, faded, Goodman and the USA Tom Malchow overtook him to pursue a personal dual for second place. Malchow touched out Goodman for silver on the final stroke of the race.
Pankratov victory and general dominance was based on his ability to swim half the first length of the pool underwater. This technique was banned shortly after the Olympic Games and swimmers can now be disqualified if they fail to surface within a 15 metre limit.

The eighth and final qualifier for the final was Paul Palmer of Great Britain. Palmer had tied Jani Sievinen for the last qualifying place which necessitated a swim-off. Incredibly the swim-off also resulted in a tie. Sievinen withdrew from the second swim-off so Palmer progressed.

The day before the 200 freestyle, he had won his first two gold medals in the 200 butterfly and with the United Statesâ 4 x 100 freestyle relay team. His biggest challenger was thought to have been his teammate, Steve Genter, but Genter had been hospitalized in Munich only four days earlier with a collapsed lung (pneumothorax), and had to have the air and fluid drained from his chest cavity. However, Genter heroically came to the line on Tuesday morning for the prelims and qualified for the final easily.
In the final Spitz went out fast, leading Soviet Vladimir Bure, later a bronze medalist in the 100 free, at the first turn. But on the second lap, Genter took over the lead, 54.93 to Spitz 55.06. Spitz closed on the third lap, but Genter turned better to regain the lead for the final 50. Defending champion Michael Wenden of Australia closed to third at 150, but he fell back in the closing metres. The final lap was all Spitz who won by five metres and almost a second, with Genter taking a courageous silver. The bronze medal went to the fast closing Werner Lampe of West Germany.

He was considered the clear favorite. Mike Wenden had already won the 100 freestyle in Mexico City but few thought he could defeat Schollander in this race. Wenden had not heard that, as he took the lead on the first lap, having half a body length on Schollander at 50 metres. He opened that to a full body length at 100 metres and then hung on.

This made van Almsick a clear favourite to win the event though some doubts, specifically about her sometimes erratic performances in heat swims, still remained. The German swimmer actually produced one of her best qualifying swims in Atlanta and was the fastest of the eight qualifiers.
The second fastest qualifier was Claudia Poll of Costa Rica, who was the current short course world champion at the distance. To everyone surprise Poll took the lead from the German at 75 metres and was never headed as she sped away to take her country first ever Olympic gold.
This completed a unique double for the Poll family as her sister Sylvia had won Costa Rica only other Olympic medal eight years earlier. After the race Van Almsick commented âI think I was
overwhelmed by the atmosphere. There were so many people there, all yelling - Iâm not used to that.â
Poll got into trouble with the Olympic authorities for wearing sponsors logos on her swimming cap and teeshirt. She was given a warning by the IOC for breaching the Olympic Charter. She returned to win more medals in 2000 and, after serving a drug suspension, also competed in 2004

A month after the Games it was revealed how lucky Czene was to be competing in Atlanta.

The second-place finisher, Norman Pritchard, was from India but lived in Britain in 1900 and was a member of the Amateur Athletic Association (AAA), but later settled in the United States and became a silent film star. His national affiliation at the 1900 Olympics has long been a matter of controversy.

Since the Korean victory in 1994, Canada, China and Italy had divided the world titles. With Italy not having qualified for the Games, the other three teams made it to the final, along with Japan. The race quickly became a duel between China and South Korea, which left Canada and Japan far behind. China kept the lead most of the way, until Yang Yang (A) was passed by Kim Yun-Mi with just a few hundred metres to go. The Koreans held on to the lead, winning in a world record time of 4:16.260. The Chinese also beat their former record, finishing just 0.123 seconds back. Canada was not threatened for the bronze.
The Korean team featured three of the four champions from Lillehammer, Jeon I-Gyeong, Won Hye-Gyeong and Kim, with [An Sang-Mi] as a new member. In 1994, they had all still been teenagers. In Nagano, all South Korean team members were at least 18-years-old.

With Sylvie Daigle and Nathalie Lambert as members, the Canadians also possessed the strongest individual skaters of the pre-Olympic seasons. The only nation that could hope to challenge them was China, which had twice improved the World Record at the pre-Olympic test event, besting the North Americans.
But China eliminated itself from contention, as Zhang Yanmei crashed hard while enjoying a comfortable last lap lead in the semi-finals. With the Chinese out, Canada was joined by the United States, Japan and the Unified Team. As the Soviet Union, the latter team had been runner-up at the last World Championships, but they were not able to challenge the Canadians.

The Canadians led the race from the early laps, followed by China, with a large gap over Korea and the US. With 10 on the lap counter, Christine Boudrias slipped away coming out of a turn, and crashed into the boards. This left China with a seemingly insurmountable lead.
But South Korea, which had sent a team of girls between 13 and 18 years old, shifted gears and pulled closer, catching up with China with five laps left. At three laps from the end, 13-year-old Kim Yun-Mi took over the lead, and the Koreans never let go. The Koreans finished 0.08 seconds outside the World Record to win the gold, making Kim Yun-Mi the youngest ever female Olympic gold medallist. China finished as second, while the Canadians had recovered quickly enough to stay ahead of the US. China joy over their silver medal lasted 45 minutes, when the referees announced the Chinese had been disqualified: One of the inactive Chinese skaters had caused a member of the American team to fall.

1020,"3,000 metres, Women",1964 Winter Olympics,37,Speed Skating,02 February 1964,"Eisschnellaufbahn im Olympiaeisstadion, Innsbruck",28 from 13 countries,na,na,"Prior to the 1963-64 season, it was felt that only one woman could challenge Lidiya Skoblikova in the longer distances and that woman was her teammate, Inga Voronina. Voronina had won the 1,500 at the 1962 World Championships, and the 3,000 at the 1961 and 1962 Worlds, and held the world record of 5:06.0, set at Medeo in 1962. But she was not in Innsbruck, not being chosen for the Soviet team due to a stomach ailment. In her absence, the gold was conceded to Skoblikova, who had won the 1963 World Championships, and won all four distances on her way to the title. She was the defending champion and had already won the previous three gold medals in Innsbruck.
The best âotherâ skater in Voronina absence was Valentina Stenina, wife of top male skater Boris Stenin. She had won the 1961 World Championships, and had placed second in the 3,000 at multiple internationals since 1960, always to Skoblikova or Voronina. Stenina started in the fourth pair and took an early lead with 5:18.5. Three pairs later, Skoblikova was up and recorded 5:14.9 to take a lead that everyone expected to hold up, and it did. In the 12th pair, Soviet skater Klara Nesterova finished in 5:22.5 to move into third, and the podium positions seemed set. Or so it seemed. But in the final pair, the 14th, North Korean skater Han Pil-hwa, whose country was making its Olympic dÃ©but at Innsbruck, started at what appeared to be a crazy pace. A virtual unknown, although she had competed at the 1963 World Championships, thru 1,800 metres she was on the same pace as Skoblikova. She could not hang on to that speed, but finished in 5:18.5 to tie Stenina and knock Nesterova off the podium.
For Skoblikova, it was a clean sweep of all four gold medals in Innsbruck, and added to her two from Squaw Valley, gave her six Olympic gold medals, still a speed skating record, for women or men, thru the 2006 Winter Olympics. The feat has never been duplicated by women, although in 1980, Eric Heiden would win all five men events. In fact, only one other woman, Yvonne van Gennip in 1988, has won three gold medals at a single Olympics since. A few weeks after Innsbruck, Skoblikova would repeat her feat, winning all four distances as she won the 1964 World Championships. As for Han, she would prove this was not a fluke. She competed internationally through the 1972 Winter Olympics, and would place third at the distance at the 1966 World Championships, and was fifth all-around at the 1965 Worlds.

Second was East Germany Karin Kessow, who won the all-around, followed by Soviet skater, Tatyana Averina, who had already won the 1,000 in Innsbruck. The world record had been set by Tamara Kuznetsova at Medeo in 1975, but she was also not at the 1976 Winter Olympics.
In the first pair East German Ines Bautzmann broke the Olympic record with 4:46.67. Averina was in the sixth pair and moved ahead, posting 4:45.19, narrowly above the world record of 4:44.69, and three seconds better than her PB. Three pairs later Norway Lisbeth Korsmo was right on Averina pace for most of the race only to miss out by a tantalizingly close margin, 4:45.24 â only 5/100ths of a second back. In the 10th pair, East German Andrea Mitscherlich was even closer, finishing in 4:45.23, especially fast when one considers that Mitscherlich had only recently turned 15-years-old. Kessow was up in the final pair, the 13th. She skated well, and was never much off the leading pace, finishing in 4:45.60. Remarkably the four top skaters were within 41/100ths of a second.
Averina was the top female skater at the 1976 Winter Olympics. She won two gold medals and two bronze medals in the four events. This was her first ever victory in a 3,000 at a major meet, as early in her career, she had primarily been considered a sprinter. Averina would win the 1978 World Championships.

Based on previous results, it would be Gunda Niemann-Stirnemann. She had won the 1997 world title, and held the world record since 1990. She had also won the World Allround Championships six times between 1991 and 1997, winning the 3,000 m on each occasion. In 1992, she had won the Olympic title in this distance, losing it surprisingly in 1994 due to a fall. But Niemann compatriot Claudia Pechstein seemed like a serious contender. At the Berlin World Cup, she had beaten Niemann, and in December she had taken Niemann World Record, although in the absence of her rival.
The first skater to break the Olympic Record, dating back to 1988, was American Jennifer Rodriguez, a former inline skater with Cuban roots. Her 4:11.64 would eventually land her in 4th place. Her time was next beaten by upcoming German star, Anni Friesinger. The next pair saw Pechstein and Hunyady taking off fast. Hunyady fell behind after a few laps, but Pechstein kept up the pace until she slowed in the final two laps. She finished in 4:08.27.
Pechstein last laps left room for Niemann, whose splits were behind Pechstein until 2,200 m. But she managed to gain a second advantage in the final two laps, thereby taking her third Olympic gold medal after two titles in 1992. The German women swept the medals, as they had done in 1984, with the difference that back then, all three women had been from East Germany, while in Nagano, Friesinger was from the former West Germany.

At the 1980 Worlds, Heiden was second and Jensen third overall. By 600 metres Jensen was about 1/2-second ahead of Heiden and that approximate margin would hold until the final lap. But Heiden tired on the last lap, and Jensen defeated her by a large margin on that lap, finishing in 4:32.13 to Heiden 4:33.77. The next pair had East German Sabine Becker, who had little international reputation at this level, as she had skated in the juniors thru 1979. At 2,600 metres she was over a second off the pace set by Jensen and Heiden, but her last lap was the fastest of the event, finishing over a second faster than Jensen, and over two seconds better than Heiden. It brought her thru in 4:32.79, which would earn her the silver medal behind Jensen. Heiden time would hold up for the bronze medal, her only medal of the 1980 Olympics, although the American press had built her up as a possibility to win medals in every event. Skating in a late pair, the 11th, was the 1976 silver medalist, Andrea Mitscherlich, who had struggled internationally since 1976, but performed well in Lake Placid and finished fourth in this race.
Because of health reasons, Becker retired from skating after the 1980 season and became a professional singer. In 1986 she defected to West Germany, and in 1988 she resumed speed skating, skating two World Cup seasons for her new country, and then retiring for good. A few weeks after Lake Placid, Jensen won the World Junior Championships. She skated internatonally thru 1988 and then seemingly retired. But in the next century, she came back and skated at the Norwegian Single Distance Championships in 2002 and 2006, at 46-years-old by 2006, placing second in the 5,000 in 2002. Through 2009, her gold medal is the only won in speed skating by a Norwegian woman, and one of only two medals.

In 2001, she had improved the world record on a lowland rink, and taken the world title in Salt Lake City. However, she had decided to become a mother, and her only appearance in the skating world in 2002 was to open a new indoor rink in Erfurt that was named for her. This left the burden of being the favorite to her compatriots, Claudia Pechstein and Anni Friesinger. Pechstein was the world record holder since March 2001, having been the first woman to beat 4 minutes in the event. She had also been the World Champion back in 2000. But in the Olympic season, she had yet to win, having been beaten by Friesinger in all the World Cup races and at the European Championships.
Friesinger, who had hoped to compete for three golds in Salt Lake, was the first competitor to beat 4 minutes, but only narrowly, and with slow laps towards the end. This gave room for Pechstein, generally able to keep her lap times stable. She did just that in her race, trailing Friesinger until 2,200 m, then winning seconds in the final two laps. Finishing in a new world record time of 3:57.70, she dragged along pair mate Cindy Klassen, who had just missed the 1998 Olympics as a member of the Canadian ice hockey squad. But Pechstein title was not yet secured. In the last pair, her splits were copied by Renate Groenewold. She kept up the pace until 2,200 m, then had to let go, finishing just ahead of Klassen for an unexpected silver medal. Even less expected was that she pushed Friesinger off the podium, leaving fourth place for the favorite.

The three favorites were all East German, led by Karin Enke, who had won the World Sprints in 1980, 1981, and 1983, and was second in 1982, and at the World Championships, she had won in 1982 and earlier in 1984, placing second in 1981 and 1983. She was expected to be challenged by Andrea SchÃ¶ne, the 1983 World Champion, who had been second to Enke in 1982 and 1984; and Gabi SchÃ¶nbrunn, who held the world record of 4:21.70, set at Medeo in 1981, and who had won the European Championships only a few weeks before at Medeo, winning the 3,000 and 5,000 at that meet. SchÃ¶ne started in the first pairing and set a formidable mark, posting 4:24.79, for an Olympic record, at the time the fourth fastest ever. In the end it would win her the gold medal. Enke started in the third group, and started faster, leading through 600 metres, but after that she fell off the pace slightly, crossing in 4:26.33, but that would be good enough for the silver medal. SchÃ¶nbrunn was in the next pair but never challenged her teammates at any time. She finished in 4:33.13, which would be good enough for the bronze medal, however.
The East German medal sweep was only the third ever in speed skating, following two in 1964 â by the Soviet women in the 500 and the Norwegian men in the 5,000 m. Enke ended her 1984 Winter Olympics with four medals â two gold and two silvers. She would end her Olympic career after the 1988 Calgary Games, eventually winning eight Olympics medals â three gold, four silver, and one bronze. Enke would also win 11 World Championships, six in the sprints, and five in the all-arounds. SchÃ¶ne had first competed at the 1976 Winter Olympics as a 15-year-old.

She won three medals in Sarajevo, one gold and two silver, and would again win three medals in Calgary, finishing her Olympic career with seven medals, but this would be her only gold.

But with three World Cup victories and a win in the European Championships, there was no reason for modesty. Her times in Heerenveen and Collalbo had been very fast (4:17), although not close to her world record of 4:10. Past results for Niemann had also been excellent, winning the distance at the past four European Championships and the 1991 World Championships, where she also captured the overall titles. Behind Niemann, her teammate and friend Heike Warnicke-Schalling seemed a secure second, while Austria Emese Hunyady appeared a safe bronze medallist. They had in fact finished first, second and third in the past three international encounters.
Hunyady and Warnicke skated in the opening pair, but it was never a real fight. Warnicke pulled away from the Austrian in the second lap, finishing in 4:22.88, nearly two seconds ahead of Hunyady. Both times were faster than Niemann winning time at the December World Cup in Albertville, so none of the other skaters approached them until Niemann herself took the ice. In her usual dominance, she was half a second faster than Warnicke from the start, and only increased that lead, eventually winning in 4:19.90. Hunyady bronze medal was Austria first speed skating medal by a woman.

World record holder in the event since 1990, she was the defending champion from Albertville 1992. She had also won the event at the 1991, 1992 and 1993 World Championships (when she also won the allround world title), and six times in a row at the European Championships from 1989 through 1994. Having skated 4.12 at the World Cup and European Championships (both held in Hamar), it was thought she might even approach the world record.
But things turned out differently. Skating in the third pair, Gunda Niemann stepped on a lane marker and fell after about 430 m. Taking her opponent Seiko Hashimoto with her, Niemann got up quickly and continued her race. But in the confusion, she continued in the wrong lane, for which she was eventually disqualified. With Niemann gone, this left Olympic gold up for grabs. Her compatriot, 1992 bronze medalist in the 5,000 m, Claudia Pechstein, was leading after Niemann fall with a strong time of 4:18.34. She had defeated another favorite, Carla Zijlstra, who had won the last pre-Olympic World Cup in absence of Niemann. In pair four, Hungarian-born Emese Hunyady (Austria) skated. The 1993 European Champion started out carefully, giving her the power for three fast final laps, landing her just ahead of Pechstein with 4:18.14. After six pairs, there was only one serious contender left: Svetlana Bazhanova. The Russian had placed second behind Niemann in the Berlin and Davos World Cups earlier in the year, and had been 3rd in the 3,000 m at the European Championships earlier in the season (behind Niemann and Zijlstra). Starting with the same pace as Pechstein, Bazhanova held on longer than the German, finishing in a new personal best of 4:17.43. The Olympic gold would remain Bazhanova only international title. In 1993 and 1998, she did win bronze medals at the European Allround Championships.

The event had co-favorites, with Soviet skater Nina Statkevich having won the 1971 World and European Championship, and the distance at the 1972 Europeans in January; and the Netherlandsâ Stien Baas-Kaiser, who was the world record holder, set in January 1971 in Davos, the defending bronze medalist from Grenoble, and who had won the distance at the 1971 World Championships. Despite these results, Baas-Kaiser was chosen only as a substitute for the Sapporo Olympics. When Trijnie Rep performed disappointingly, she was allowed to skate, and would justify her selection with silver in the 1,500 and gold in this event. Statkevich was off in the second pair and finished in 5:01.79, well off Baas-Kaiser world record of 4:46.5. American Dianne Holum was in the next pair, and bettered Statkevich time with 4:58.67 to take the lead. And that time held up until Baas-Kaiser went off in the next-to-last pair, and she shattered Holum time, finishing in 4:52.14 to easily win the gold medal, with Holum holding on for the silver, and the bronze going to Dutchwoman Atje Keeulen-Deelstra. Statkevich placed fifth. For her, after winning the 1971 World and European Championships, it was a disappointing Olympics with two fifth places and a sixth. For Baas-Kaiser, this was her first gold medal and fourth Olympic medal. She would skate at the World Sprints and World Championships in the coming weeks, and then retire at the end of an esteemed career that saw her win four Olympic medals, the 1967 and 1968 World Championships, and set nine world records.

At the five international 3,000 ms held in the 1987-1988 season, five East Germans had divided the medals. Three of them had won a race, and all three of them were racing in Calgary: Gabi Zange, Karin Kania and Andrea Ehrig. In fact, these three women had occupied the podium at the 1984 Olympics, when Ehrig had beaten Kania and Zange for the title. In the present season, Kania had won the World Cup races in Berlin and Butte, while Ehrig had won in Davos and at the European Championships. Zange had won the World Cup in Calgary, en passant breaking the world record and lowering it to 4:16.76. That record had been in the hands of Yvonne van Gennip, who had skated 4:16.85 in Heerenveen the previous season. But van Gennip had suffered from various injuries in the past months, and had recovered only just in time for the Olympics.
The race started dramatically, with Ehrig racing against Kania. The latter took off at an insane pace. Barely half-way through the race, Kania had a five-second advantage on Zange world record. Unsurprisingly, she hit the wall, and barely made it to the finish line, needing almost 40 seconds for the final lap. Ehrig, in the meanwhile, had been able to keep her pace, setting a world record of 4:12.09, well below the old mark. Zange herself, riding in the third pair, approximately matched her own world record (4:16.92), which was enough to beat Kania, but not Ehrig. Van Gennip was behind the leading times for the entire race, but not by far. With her final lap, she made up for the 0.63 second deficit, and crossed the line in 4:11.94, for a very surprising gold medal. It would be the first of her three Olympic titles in Calgary, matching the feat of her compatriot Ard Schenk in 1972.

At the recent World Championships, the distance had been won by Lidiya Skoblikova (URS-1960), Eevi Huttunen (FIN-1959), and Inga Artamanova (URS-1958). Skoblikova had already won the 1,500 metres in Squaw Valley. The other two Soviet skaters in the event, who had to be considered as no non-Soviet woman had been on the all-around podium at the World Championships since 1952, were Tamara Rylova and Valentina Stenina, wife of top men skater, Boris Stenin. Stenina had recently won the 1960 World Championships in all-around, and had been second at this distance.
Twenty skaters came to the mark. Rylova was in the third pair and took the lead, but her time of 5:30.0 would place her only ninth. The next favorite to skate was Stenina in the seventh pair. Her time of 5:16.9 was considered fast, and put her into a comfortable lead. Huttunen was up two pairs later, and although she was ahead of Stenina pace through 2,200 metres, she struggled on the final laps, finishing in 5:21.0. Skoblikova was in the last pair, the 10th, but the day was cold, and the ice was still good. She led throughout, finishing in 5:14.3, the second fastest time ever. It was her second gold medal of the 1960 Winter Olympics, and four years later in Innsbruck, she would win all four women races.

This event was expected to be contested between these two. But despite her recent loss, Kaiser had to be favored. She had also won the 1967 World Championship, winning the 3K en route, and had set the last three world records. The most recent had been set nine days before this event in Davos, avenging her loss to Schut, recording 4:54.6.
Their teammate, Wil Burgmeijer, was in the first pair and broke the Olympic record with 5:05.1 for a mark to shoot at, though it would eventually bring her only fifth. Schut was in the fifth pair and blasted through the laps in 4:56.2, the third fastest time ever. Kaiser was in the 12th pair. She was hampered by rain that had started to fall, quickly dropped off Schut pace, and was four seconds behind at 1,000 metres. And she would never close that gap, finishing in 5:01.3, also behind Kaija Mustonen, who had finished in 5:01.0 in the seventh pair. In the end that was the podium with Schut getting gold, Mustonen silver, and Kaiser bronze.
Schut had been a top distance skater but she had often finished second at 3,000, usually to Kaiser. But in coming years, she would win the distance frequently, at the 1969 and 1970 World Championships and the 1970 European Championships.

The heavy favorite for the gold in Beijing was Irene Schouten, who had won the first two World Cups of the season by large margins, and had also claimed the European title in January. She had gotten close competition from compatriot Antoinette de Jong, the 2021 World Champion, and Francesca Lollobrigida, who had won the third 2021/2022 World Cup in Schouten absence.
The first contenders for a medal came in the third pair. Defending champion Carlijn Achtereekte, who had only narrowly qualified for the Dutch team, faced Miho Takagi, the 2018 all-around world champion. Despite challenge, Takagi led all the way to 4:01.77, dethroning Achtereekte. De Jong, in the first pair after the ice preparation break, attacked that time, but faded in the second half of her race and finished in 4:02.37, which eventually would bring her eighth place.
The 2010 champion Martina SÃ¡blÃ­kovÃ¡ also attacked Takagi time, but managed to keep a gap of around one second, eventually finishing in 4:00.34. In pair nine, reigning 1,500 m World Champion Ragne Wiklund recorded the fastest time after 2,200 m, a second ahead of SÃ¡blÃ­kovÃ¡. But while Wiklund faded, her pairmate Isabelle Weidemann ended with two solid laps to become the first under 4 minutes with 3:58.64.
Per her usual tactics, Lollobrigida led from the start in the final pair, trailed by Schouten. Both were well below Weidemann pace halfway through the race. Schouten passed the Italian after 2 km, but Lollobrigida managed to cling on, and just 0.29 seconds separated the two at the bell. Schouten then powered away to a new Olympic Record (3:56.93), while Lollobrigida held on for silver â the first ever Olympic speed skating medal by an Italian woman.
Despite placing in the back of the field, 2002 champion Claudia Pechstein broke several records. This race meant her eighth Olympic Winter Games appearance, tying the record in any sport for most participations, held by Japanese ski jumper Noriaki Kasai. Just two weeks shy of her 50th birthday, she also became the oldest female winter Olympian, and the second-oldest Olympic speed skater (behind Albert Tebbit).

The Dutchwoman had won Olympic gold in the event in 2006 and 2014, while winning world titles in 2011, 2013 and 2017. Czech Republic SÃ¡blÃ­kovÃ¡ had won the 2010 Olympic title and was World Champion in 2007, 2012 and 2015-16. In addition, SÃ¡blÃ­kovÃ¡ had won the combined 3,000 m/5,000 m World Cup 11 seasons in a row, since 2006/2007. Despite these impressive records, neither woman was in great shape in the run-up to the Olympics. Both had suffered from injuries early in the skating season, and neither had recorded a win in the World Cup circuit. Others were eager to step in the void left by these dominant skaters, with World Cup wins recorded by Antoinette de Jong, Miho Takagi, Nataliya Voronina and Ivanie Blondin.
None of these would claim the gold, however, as it was quite unexpectedly won by Carlijn Achtereekte. She had surprisingly secured a spot in one of the major commercial teams, and had earned the third Olympic spot at the Dutch trials, behind De Jong and WÃ¼st. In Pyeongchang, she skated early in the field, recording 3:59.21, a fraction slower than the track record that had been set by WÃ¼st at the 2017 World Championships. WÃ¼st was the first of the favorites to race, and she seemed to comfortably go below Achtereekte mark, having a 1.5 second lead with just 2 laps to go. But WÃ¼st pace slowed in the final 400 m, and she crossed the line a fraction slower: 3:59.28. The 11th pair saw Takagi and De Jong competing, but neither seriously approached Achtereekte splits. De Jong came closest with 4:00.02, leaving three Dutch women in medal positions with one pair left. In that final pair, SÃ¡blÃ­kovÃ¡ recorded consistent lap times, but without her usual speed. A good final lap did bring her close to the podium, but she couldnât do better than 4:00.54. The Dutch sweep of the medals was the third time a single country won all medals in the 3,000 m.

Germany Claudia Pechstein, winner in 2002, competed in her 6th Olympics at 41, having missed the Vancouver Games due to a controversial blood passport suspension. In November 2013, she had won the first World Cup of the season. The 2006 champion Ireen WÃ¼st (Netherlands) had won the 2011 and 2013 world titles, and had claimed a win in this distance at the European Championships in January, beating Martina SÃ¡blÃ­kovÃ¡, the defending Olympic champion and 2012 World Champion, who had won two World Cups earlier in the season.
The first skater to approach the track record of 4:02.43 (set by WÃ¼st at the 2013 World Championships) was home favorite, Olga Graf. A better 5,000 m skater, she had never placed better than 5th in a 3,000 m World Cup, but now recorded a strong 4:03.47 on home ice. Her race saw just a 0.76 second difference between her best and worst lap. Obviously happy with her performance, Graf enthusiastically unzipped her suit after the race, nearly causing a âwardrobe malfunctionâ as she wasnât wearing a bra. Graf strong finish turned out to be too good for Pechstein, who lost nearly 3 seconds to Graf in the last two laps. SÃ¡blÃ­kovÃ¡ got off to a faster start than Graf, and, as expected, was able to stick with her schedule. She beat WÃ¼st track record, the new mark now being 4:01.95. WÃ¼st herself was up next. Typically racing with a faster start but a slower finish, WÃ¼st recorded the fastest opening laps, but she managed to beat SÃ¡blÃ­kovÃ¡ laps through the 2,200 m mark, after which she only conceded about a second. This was sufficient for WÃ¼st to reclaim her 2006 title, and earn her third Olympic gold medal in all. Graf held on for bronze, while Pechstein 4th place meant Germany was not on the podium on this event for the first time since 1972.

She had also become World All-round Champion in 2009, and won the European title in 2007 and 2010. Two of SÃ¡blÃ­kovÃ¡ expected top opponents were not in medal contention. Claudia Pechstein, the 2002 champion, had been suspended for illegal blood values at the 2009 World Championships. Since she had not actually been caught using doping, Pechstein had fought this suspension right up to the Olympics at several courts, but without success.

The event had not been held at the 2001 World Championships, when it was cancelled because of weather conditions. The best female cross-country skier of the past five years had been Norwegian Bente Skari-Martinsen, but she was better in the shorter distances. The early leader in this race was Russian Larisa Lazutina, the 1999 World Champion and 2001 Holmenkollen champion in the event. And she was the late leader too, winning by almost two minutes over Italy Gabriella Paruzzi. Lazutina led at every checkpoint and had the fastest intermediate split for each time check. But she would not win the gold medal.
In December 2003 it was revealed that Lazutina had tested positive for darpopoietin, an erythropoietin analogue, and was disqualified from all events in Salt Lake City. Her teammate, Olga Danilova, who had originally finished eighth had been discovered two months earlier and was also disqualified. This brought Paruzzi up to a very surprising gold medal, as she had never won an individual medal before at three Winter Olympics or the World Championships. The silver medalist became Italy Stefania Belmondo while Skari-Martinsen won the bronze. For Belmondo this was her 10th Olympic medal, equaling the Winter Olympic record for women held by Soviet/Unified Team skier Raisa Smetanina, both trailing only Norway BjÃ¸rn DÃ¦hlie among men, who won 12.

In her absence, the favorites were considered the other medalists from the 1993 Worlds, her teammate Manuela Di Centa, and Russian Lyubov Yegorova. Di Centa already had four medals in Lillehammer and had won the 15 km 11 days previously. Di Centa was fast from the start, leading at every checkpoint. But she never led by much, closely chased throughout by Norway Marit Wold, who started only two positions later. In the end they would win the gold and silver medals, Di Centa winning her second gold of the 1994 Winter Olympics. This would be Wold only individual Olympic medal in her career, but she would win a bronze in the event at the 1997 World Championships. The bronze medal here went to an old warhorse, Finland Marja-Liisa Kirvesniemi-HÃ¤mÃ¤lÃ¤inen, who had won all three individual events at the 1984 Winter Olympics. This was the seventh, and final, Olympic medal of her career. Yegorova was never a factor. She was eighth at the first checkpoint, and still seventh halfway through, before finishing fifth.

Both had won three gold medals and four medals in Albertville, but DÃ¦hlie was just starting his career and had by now surpassed his teammate. Ulvang had been second to him in the 1991-92 World Cup and third in the 1992-93 season. He was a three-time champion at Holmenkollen in the 50 km (1989, 1991-92), and he was renowned in Norway, having been chosen to speak the Oath of the Athletes at the Lillehammer Opening Ceremony, but the 1993-94 season had been difficult for him. In November 1993, Ulvang brother, Kjetil, had been skiing home when he got lost in a blinding snowstorm and disappeared. Over the next weeks and months, Vegard Ulvang stopped training and began looking for his brother. At one press conference before Lillehammer, his emotions burst forth when he tearfully told the press corps that after the Winter Olympics, he would go back to looking for Kjetil, âI will look for him and I will find him.â They did find Kjetil, but sadly at the bottom of a lake where he had apparently fallen in the blizzard conditions. Vegard Ulvang competed at Lillehammer but at less than his best, and was not entered in the 30 km.
But by 1994 DÃ¦hlie was the best cross-country skier in the world and was expected to win this event, especially since it was in freestyle, his stronger style. He started well and led at all checkpoints as he went through, starting in the 60th spot. But a few starters later, Finland Mika MyllylÃ¤ posted a faster time at the first checkpoint, but he would not be able to maintain that pace, eventually dropping back to third place and the bronze medal. But starting 69th was DÃ¦hlie teammate, Thomas Alsgaard, who was only 22-years-old and had little international experience. He was seventh at the 1.7 km time check, but moved ahead at 7.1 km, and led the rest of the way to win a surprising gold medal by over 47 seconds ahead of his legendary teammate. It was the start of a great career for Alsgaard who would ski at the 1998 and 2002 Winter Olympics, winning gold medals in the pursuit and relay in both years.

But her skiing in the 1997-98 was somewhat ordinary and she would not be a major factor, eventually finishing fifth, still her best individual finish in Hakuba. With her struggling, the race was fairly open.  The leader at every checkpoint as she skied was Russian Yuliya Chepalova, who started 28th. Six starters later, Stefania Belmondo, runner-up at the 1997 World Championships, and 1997 Holmenkollen champion in the event, took the lead at the 11.3 and 22.3 km time checks. But Chepalova would finish faster and win a surprising gold medal.
Chepalova would later develop into a solid skier, but she had only been on the Russian national team since 1996, and was mostly unknown internationally. She would return in 2002 at Salt Lake City and win a gold medal in the new sprint event. Belmondo had won this event at the 1992 Winter Olympics, the 1993 World Championships, and 1997 Holmenkollen Ski Festival.

She had come back to win the 2009 World Championships in the event, had also won the distance World Cup in 2008-09, and was leading that competition coming into Vancouver, narrowly ahead of BjÃ¸rgen. At 20 km there will still a number of skiers in contention, but after ski changes Kowalczyk and BjÃ¸rgen began to pull away from the field, until only these two were in contention for the gold and silver. BjÃ¸rgen made the first move, pulling ahead of Kowalczyk with a few kilometres to go and gaining around a 6-second advantage, but the lead was never decisive and Kowalczyk caught up with her on the final climb. It then came down to a sprint to the line which Kowalczyk won, covering the course in a time of 1-30:33.7, just 0.3 seconds ahead of BjÃ¸rgen. The bronze medal was won by Aino-Kaisa Saarinen (FIN), her finishing time being over a minute behind the other medallists, but comfortably ahead of fourth placed Evi Sachenbacher-Stehle (GER). After the race, Kowalczyk apologized to BjÃ¸rgen for her accusations, âI am sorry, because it wasnât such a good time for such a question and opinion. It wasnât an attack on Marit. She is a very good athlete, but I was trying to talk about the asthma problem we have in cross-country, there are a lot of athletes sick with asthma.â BjÃ¸rgen also addressed the issue after the race, âThat annoyed me a little bit, but for me it already yesterday news.

After winning the 30 km race, she took her career total to eight gold, four silver and three bronze medals as she overtook fellow Norwegians Ole Einar BjÃ¸rndalen (8/4/1 in biathlon) and BjÃ¸rn DÃ¦hlie (8/4/0 in cross country skiing), as the leading medalist.
Like Finland Iivo Niskanen, in the men 50 km race the day before, BjÃ¸rgen won the women longest cross-country race after a long solo run. After just 10 km, she broke away from the lead group that included some of the top skiers: Sweden gold medalists Charlotte Kalla (skiathlon) und Stina Nilsson (sprint), two times bronze medalist Krista PÃ¤rmÃ¤koski, Kerttu Niskanen, the sister of the men 50 km winner, and relay gold medalist Ingvild Flugstad Ãstberg from Norway. The least expected runner in the top group was Austrian Teresa Stadlober, who was to become a tragic figure in a later phase.
When she changed her skies at the half way mark, BjÃ¸rgen was already 51 seconds ahead of the chasing group, and she kept increasing the pace, leading by 1:20 from Stadlober (second) and PÃ¤rmÃ¤koski (third) with 10 km to go. Kalla was the first to drop out of the race for a medal, when she changed her skies, unlike the rest of the group, and never managed to close the gap again. As in the men event, the tactics of changing skies again proved to be a decisive factor.
With BjÃ¸rgen constantly increasing the lead, Stadlober caused the next excitement. When she tried to break away from PÃ¤rmÃ¤koski, she made an unbelievable mistake, and took the wrong track. The detour cost her over one minute, and from a sure medal position, she dropped to eighth place. Now PÃ¤rmÃ¤koski was BjÃ¸rgen main chaser and almost in reach of the silver medal. But behind her, Ãstberg, Nilsson and Niskanen, the sister of the 50 km winner, had not yet given up the fight to win more than bronze. They were in sight of PÃ¤rmÃ¤koski, but the Finn held on to a lead of just 10 seconds to secure silver, with Nilsson narrowly defeating Ãstberg by just 1.5 seconds for third place. Niskanen, who was among the top five throughout the race, lost contact with Nilsson and Ãstberg when she changed her skies at 22.5 km, and was eventually overtaken by Kalla who finished fifth.
Like Sochi in 2014, and the last World Championships, gold went to Marit BjÃ¸rgen. She had a two-minute lead at the final intermediate time, which was reduced to 1:49.5 at the finishing line, as she celebrated victory on the home stretch, waving the flag of her home country. The Norwegian was the fastest skier in 15 out of 24 sectors, Nilsson was faster only in the last two sectors while fighting for bronze, and PÃ¤rmÃ¤koski failed to clock the best time in any sector.

It was also the first men cross-country event in Salt Lake City, starting shortly after the women finished racing 15 km. There was no suspense over the winner of the event, however, as Spain Johann MÃ¼hlegg, a German Ã©migrÃ© who obtained Spanish citizenship in 1999, dominated, taking the lead early, and winning by over two full minutes. Austrians Christian Hoffmann and Mikhail Botvinov, who had changed citizenship from Russia in 1996, finished second and third. At least the battle for the other medals was close, as Norwegian biathlon star Ole Einar BjÃ¸rndalen led the pack coming into the final lap, but was passed by the Austrians and Italian Pietro Piller Cottrer. Norway Kristen Skjeldal also passed BjÃ¸rndalen, who originally finished sixth. In the end, these five would battle out the medals over the final lap, with less than 13.5 seconds separating them, as Hoffmann outsprinted Botvinov to the line, winning by 1.3 seconds.
But two weeks later it would all change. On 23 February, MÃ¼hlegg won the 50 km, his third gold medal in Salt Lake City as he had also won the pursuit, only to fail his doping screen, testing positive for darbopoietin, an erythropoietin analogue. He lost the 50 km, and the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruled in December 2003 that he could be stripped of all three gold medals from the 2002 Winter Olympics. So the final standings eventually saw Hoffmann elevated to the gold medal, Botvinov the silver, and Skjeldal the bronze. As the FIS now changes the Winter Olympic program frequently, this was also the last 30 km race, at least for some time, as it was not held in 2006 or 2010, having first been contested at the Olympics in 1956.

In 1:24:54.0, Johaug took her third Beijing gold with a brutal high tempo race and, as a result, won all distance races at these Games. It was also the last Olympic race of her career. At Vancouver in 2010, Johaug had won gold in the relay, and four years later in Sochi won silver over 30 km freestyle, and bronze over the 10 km classical. She was absent at PyeongChang 2018 due to a doping ban. Jessie Diggins from the USA secured second place 1:43.3 behind Johaug in Beijing, while bronze went to Kerttu Niskanen of Finland (+2:33.3).
At minus 14Â° C, Johaug took the lead right from the start and set an extremely high pace. In addition to Diggins, only the Swede Ebba Andersson and the Frenchwoman Delphine Claudel were able to keep up with her. But one by one Johaug shook off her chasers. Halfway through the race she was 27 seconds ahead of Diggins and 1:15 ahead of Andersson.

In the 2017-18 season, only one men skiathlon was contested, at Lillehammer in December 2017 with four Norwegians finishing in the first four: KlÃ¦bo first, then triple World Cup winner Martin Johnsrud Sundby, followed by Hans Christer Holund and Simen Hegstad KrÃ¼ger. KrÃ¼ger was a relative newcomer, having won his first World Cup race in December 2017, over 15 km freestyle.
In PyeongChang, nobody dared to break away from a large leading group for the first 25 km, with the favorites still cautious, and pace moderate. KrÃ¼ger, less fancied than his compatriots, was involved in a fall, along with two OAR athletes, just a few hundred metres from the start. But with less than 5 km from the finish line, he got into a position where he was in with a chance to escape the pack, and he took it, and within just one kilometer, KrÃ¼ger opened a gap of 22 seconds. The pursuers hesitated for too long as it was not until about 27 km that Sundby started the pursuit , with Holund close behind. But KrÃ¼ger held on to his lead to become a surprise winner with Sundby second, just eight seconds behind and Holund in third, another two seconds adrift. Most of the favorites finished among the top ten: Maurice Manificat from France was fifth, Cologna sixth, Canadian Alex Harvey eighth, and KlÃ¦bo tenth.
With a clean sweep in the first men event, the Norwegians gave an indication of their superiority in the men cross-country in PyeongChang. Like other races in the first few days of the Games, it was characterized by ice cold weather of minus 13Â° C and stormy gusts of wind.

The 2009 World Champion was Petter Northug of Norway, who was leading the World Cup in 2009-10 and would star in Vancouver with four medals and two golds, but he had wax problems in this race, would break a pole, and finished only 11th. The leader at the pit stop was LukÃ¡Å¡ Bauer of the Czech Republic, somewhat of a classical specialist, with Switzerland Dario Cologna, already the winner of the 15 km in Vancouver, in second, and Sweden Johan Olsson in third. In the freestyle, Olsson quickly moved into the lead, but he was gradually caught and passed on the final hill by his teammate Marcus Hellner, and then by Tobias Angerer (GER) on the run in to the home straight. Hellner held a comfortable lead as he entered the finishing straight and finished in a time of 1-15:11.4 to win the gold medal, 2.1 seconds ahead of Angerer. Olsson held on to take the bronze medal, defeating a fast finishing Aleksandr Legkov (RUS) by 1.2 seconds.

In 2002 it was contested as 10 km classical followed by 10 km freestyle pursuit, but in 2006 both distances were increased to 15 km. Also, while the event had previously been run with interval starts in the classical, it was now a mass start, a format that was first dÃ©buted internationally at the 2005 World Championships. This was an unusual event as no skier was able to place in the top eight of both styles. The leader after the classical was Czech LukÃ¡Å¡ Bauer. Back in 13th place was Norwegian Frode Estil, but he could be excused. He fell at the start and broke a ski, and by the time it was replaced, he was in last place of the 76 starters, but skied brilliantly from there and was only 3.7 seconds out of the lead at the finish. In the freestyle pursuit, the leader for most of the race was Italy Pietro Piller Cottrer, who had been third in the morning race. But he was caught at the line by Russian Yevgeny Dementyev, who won a surprising gold medal. Estil also caught Piller Cottrer at the line. The finish was the closest podium ever in cross-country pursuit, with only 0.9 seconds separating the three medalists. Piller Cottrer was one of only three skiers to place in the top 10 in both styles.

The surprise 1982 World Champion at the distance, Sweden Thomas Eriksson, was not able to qualify for the 1984 Olympics. Nikolay Zimyatov, the triple gold medalist in cross-country skiing at the 1980 games, was not on the Soviet team for the 1982 World Championships, and kept a low international profile in the years before the 1984 Games, but in January 1984 he won the Soviet 30 km Championships, and was selected for the Olympic team. At 30 km, the opening distance of the 1984 Games, Zimyatov showed that he was a man for big Olympic occasions. At the first intermediate time (6.8 km) he was in the lead, 17 seconds ahead of his teammate Aleksandr Zavyalov, with another Soviet skier, 22-year-old Vladimir Sakhnov, in fourth place, 32 seconds behind the leader. The only man who was able to split the Soviet trio was Sweden new cross-country star, Gunde  Svan, lying third two seconds ahead of Sakhnov. For the rest of the race the situation among the leading quartet was unchanged. At the last intermediate point, 8 km from home, Zimyatov had extended his lead to 46 seconds over Zavyalov, Svan only nine seconds behind. Zimyatov comfortably won his fourth Olympic gold medal with a margin of 27 seconds over his teammate Zavyalov. Svan, with the strongest finish, was only nine seconds behind Zavyalov in third place. Finland best was Aki Karvonen in fifth place, over two minutes behind the winner, and the silver medalist from the 1982 World Championships, Norway Lars Erik  Eriksen followed in sixth, almost another half a minute behind.
With four Olympic gold medals in cross-country skiing, Zimyatov was now equal to two other cross-country skiers: the great Swede Sixten  Jernberg (1964) and the cross-country queen of the 1970s, Galina  Kulakova.

The event was first held at the FIS World Championship program at Falun, Sweden in 1954, and at that championship the Soviet skiers made their first international appearance. A 23-year-old skier from Arkhangelsk, Vladimir Kuzin, won ahead of the 1952 50 km. Olympic champion, Veikko Hakulinen. These two were the hottest favorites for an Olympic gold in this new event. Kuzin was definitively the king of cross-country skiing at Falun in 1954, also winning the 50 km. and winning a third gold medal as a member of the gold medal winning Soviet team in the relay.
Under difficult snow conditions, the rising Swedish star Sixten Jernberg, who placed fourth at the distance in Falun two years before, was in front after 10 km., six seconds faster than Hakulinen. The four Soviet skiers were all among the first seven. At 20 km. Hakulinen had taken the lead eight seconds ahead of Jernberg. Pavel Kolchin, a 26-year-old Soviet skier from Dynamo Moskva, was third, followed by his three teammates. Hakulinen, starting last of the favorites, increased his lead over the last 10 km. and won his second Olympic gold medal, 24 seconds ahead of Jernberg. Kolchin took the bronze medal, only one second ahead of another Soviet skier, Anatoly Shelyukin. Kuzin was the fastest finisher of the Soviet skiers and advanced to fifth place, but was over two minutes behind Hakulinen. The Norwegians had a bad day. Their best skier, the 1952 18 km. Olympic Champion Hallgeir Brenden, was a distant 14th, over five minutes behind the winner. Kolchin bronze was historic, as it was the first Nordic skiing medal won by a nation other than Finland, Norway, or Sweden.

He was highly favored before the first cross country event in the 1968 Games, the 30 km race. But the first intermediate times at 10 km produced some surprises. Franco Nones, a 27-year old Italian skier who had placed 6th at the distance at the 1966 World Championships, had built up a substantial lead, 22 seconds ahead of another surprise, Soviet Union Vladimir Voronkov, aged only 23 and originating from the Chuvash Republic in the Volga region. MÃ¤ntyranta was in third position another 7 seconds behind Voronkov, closely followed by Norwegian Odd Martinsen and Kalevi Laurila, who was second behind MÃ¤ntyranta at the 1966 Worlds.
Over the next 10 km of the race, MÃ¤ntyranta made a gallant try to catch the leading Italian, and moved up to second position at 20 km, only 4 seconds behind Nones. Martinsen had advanced to third, but was still over a half minute behind the leader. But MÃ¤ntyranta had apparently made his move too early. He faded badly over the last 10 km and lost over a minute to Nones, who secured the first cross country Olympic gold medal for a skier coming from outside the Nordic countries or Soviet Union. Martinsen passed MÃ¤ntyranta in the fight for silver, and the defending champion had to settle for the bronze medal. Another fast finishing Italian, Giulio De Florian, bronze medalist at the distance in the World Championships 1962,  advanced from 8th to 5th position during the last stages of the race, finishing only two seconds behind Voronkov in 4th place.
Norwegian Gjermund Eggen, the king of the 1966 World Championships in Oslo with three gold medals, was a great disappointment, placing a modest 34th in what would be his only Olympic appearance. Three weeks after the 1968 Olympics he outclassed his rivals in Falun, Sweden, winning the 30 km race 1:18 ahead of his closest rival.

But the Soviet Union had a strong team, headed by 24-year old Nikolay Zimyatov, the tall and lanky silver medalist at the distance at the 1978 World Championships. At 10 km, Zimyatov was in the lead, 13 seconds ahead of the Swede Thomas Wassberg. Lying third, to everyone surprise, was Bulgarian Ivan Lebanov, 1977 Junior World Champion, 19.5 seconds behind the leader. And the young Bulgarian continued to impress. At the halfway mark he had moved up to second place, 36 seconds behind the leading Zimyatov, but he was closely followed by Wassberg and Soviet Vasily Rochev. Zimyatov continued to push the pace, at 20 km he had widened his lead to 40 seconds, but behind him it was very close: Wassberg now second, Lebanov third and Rochev fourth, all three within 8 seconds. Rochev, starting first of the favorites, was fastest over the last 10 km and finished in impressive style. Zimyatov, starting one minute behind Lobanov, caught the Bulgarian 5 km from home, and they finished together. Zimyatov came in half a minute ahead of his countryman Rochev, and Lobanov was now in bronze medal position. Wassberg, starting last of all, could not match Lobanov speed over the last kilometers and had to be content with fourth place.

MÃ¤ntyranta was World Champion at 30 km in 1962, and one of the heavy favorites for the event in the Olympics two years later. The Swedish team was still lead by Sixten Jernberg, now close to 35 but still considered as one of the best long distance skiers. Janne Stefansson, silver medallist at the distance in the World Championships 1962, was also considered among the favorites, together with Italian Giulio De Florian, bronze medalist in 1962. De Florian however had to withdraw from the 30 km due to illness.
The Finn Kalevi Lauria, who had a reputation as a fast opener, took an early lead at the 10 km mark, starting as number 4. His intermediate time was beaten by the Norwegian Ole EllefsÃ¦ter by a few seconds, but shortly afterwards he had to drop out of the race due to trouble with his skies. MÃ¤ntyranta, starting next to last of the 70 competitors, bettered Laurila time by 14 seconds and the favorite was in the lead. At 20 km MÃ¤ntyranta had opened a gap of 1:05 to Laurila, still in second place, but closely followed by Soviet Union Igor Voronchikhin and Norway Harald GrÃ¸nningen, only two and three seconds behind Laurila.

During the 1973-74 season the old wooden skis had been replaced by the new fiberglass ski. Also, a new generation of skiers had taken over, and the Soviet Union had emerged as the leading cross-country nation, not only among the women but also in the men events. Also other East European countries had developed top cross-country skiers, notably East Germany, Poland and Czechoslovakia had won medals at the 1974 World Championships.
As usual, the 30 km race for men was the opening cross-country event. At 10 km, Norwegian Ivar Formo was in the lead, two seconds ahead of the 22-year old Soviet newcomer, Nikolay Bazhukov. At the next intermediate time, 20 km, the Soviet skiers had taken over the race. Bazhukov was in the lead, eight seconds ahead of his teammate Sergey Savelyev, with Ivan Garanin, another Soviet skier, in third place, 17 seconds behind the leader. The biggest surprise come from a young American, 20-year old Bill Koch, who had moved up to fourth place, two seconds ahead of Formo, who had dropped from first to fifth. Juha Mieto, the big Finn who had won silver at the distance at the 1974 World Championships, was also advancing in the field, moving up to sixth place. Mieto, wearing start #2, was the first of the favorites to reach the finish, skiing strongly over the last 10 km. Koch, the surprising American, was next. He had had a nine second lead over Mieto after 20 km, and he took over the first position, bettering Mieto time by 22 seconds. When Garanin, next of the top contenders to finish, was not able to better Koch time, the chances for a sensational cross-country medal for the USA began to seem possible. But Savelyev, lying second after 20 km, had the strongest finish of all and took over the lead, 28 seconds ahead of Koch. None of the late starting favorites could match the finishing times of Savelyev and Koch. Formo faded badly and ended in 11th place. Bazhyukov, the leader at 20 km, could not keep the pace over the last 10 km and finished behind Mieto in fifth place.
The new Olympic Champion Savelyev was relatively unmerited on the international circuit, his best placing was fifth at the 1975 Holmenkollen over 50 km. He was born in the Amur region in the Far East, and started serious training at the age of 19 when he was a soldier in the Moscow region. He explained that was because it was too cold to train for skiing in the winter in his childhood village, when temperatures could reach -50 degrees Celsius. Bill Koch, the surprising silver medalist, had shown a great talent as a junior, but nobody had expected him to win the first medal for an American in top-level cross-country competition.

Sweden Sixten Jernberg, silver medalist from 1956 and third in the World Championships 1958, was highly favored among the experts.
Jernberg, having a late starting number and therefore able to control his rivals, was in the lead after 10 km, 22 seconds ahead of his countryman Rolf RÃ¤mgÃ¥rd. He was closely followed by two Soviet skiers, the 23-year old newcomer Gennady Vaganov and the more merited Nikolay Anikin, a member of the Soviet gold winning relay team in 1956. Hakulinen, apparently not in his best shape, was in fifth place, already 1:20 behind the leader. At 20 km, Jernberg was in the lead, still 22 seconds ahead of RÃ¤mgÃ¥rd, but the Swedish pair had increased the gap to the two Soviet skiers, who were now almost a minute behind the leader.

the 4 x 100 metres freestyle relay epitomized the Sydney Olympic Games to the people of Australia.
This was an epic struggle between the best swimming nations in the world and, at least for the home nation, ended in a victory of epic proportions. The background to the race was fairly clear â the US always wins this race at the Olympic Games but this time Australia had a quartet of high quality and their most recent, at the 1999 Pan-Pacific Championships, had resulted in a rare win for the Aussies.
Before the Games things even got a bit personal between the two teams as the USA Gary Hall, Jr.  predicted that his team would âSmash the Aussies like guitarsâ.
In the final Michael Klim got the Australians off to the best possible start by breaking the world record for the 100 metres freestyle on the opening flag. The second and third legs followed the same pattern as the USA chased down Australia and took the lead only to lose that lead before the changeover. The big guns took to the pool on the anchor leg with Hall facing Ian Thorpe to resolve the dispute. Once again American started quickly and pulled out a gap on his rival but Thorpe was relentless in the chase and, with the crowd whipped up into frenzy, took the lead with five strokes left and held on record a memorable victory. Needless to say both teams smashed the existing world record. In celebration and noting Hall comment, Michael Klim played air guitar to the Australian fans.

At the first changeover in the final the USA were out of the medals in fourth and, although over the next two legs they improved, they were still trailing Russia and Germany and a shock defeat appeared likely.
However the two European nations had top loaded their best swimmers whilst the American trump card Gary Hall, Jr. was to swim the anchor leg for the home team. Hall took two seconds off his main rivals and vaulted his team to a clear victory. Their only disappointment was that they failed, by a third of a second, to break the world record.
For Hall this was the first gold medal of the five he won during his career and meant that he followed his father, also Gary Hall, as an Olympic champion.

The day after the medley relay, Palestine terrorists from the Black September group would attack the Israeli Olympic team in the Olympic Village, eventually killing 11 of them. The Olympics and world sport would never be the same. Mark Spitz was Jewish and quickly left Munich, fearing for his fame and his heritage.

But now in second was the United States, as Charlie Daniels swam a great leg to pass Britain Willie Foster.  They finished their legs, respectively, in 8:15.2 and 8:18.6.  The race appeared to be over, with Hungary redoubtable ZoltÃ¡n von  Halmay swimming their anchor leg.  But mainly a sprinter, he went out far too fast, leading Leslie Rich (USA) by 15 yards after 700 metres, with Britain Henry Taylor another 5 yards back.  Taylor caught Rich with 50 metres left and pulled away from him.  Halmay was now a shambles and swam into the wall only 20 metres from the finish, also allowing Taylor to pass him and win by 3 yards.

Nobody could really envision how close, although Sports Illustrated Craig Neff did call it, predicting in the Olympic Preview issue, âThe West Germans will likely lose their world record and the gold medal to the U.S. â but just barely.â That record went in the heats as the US B team came home in 7:18.87 for a world record to qualify first.
US coach Don Gambril made the choice to lead off with America best, Mike Heath, and make the Germans catch up, as the German anchor would certainly be Michael GroÃ, probably the top male freestyler in Los Angeles. On the first leg Heath went ahead of Thomas Fahrner, 1:48.67 to 1:49.83. On the next leg David Larson extended the lead to 2.87 seconds at 300 metres, but he had gone out too fast, and Dirk Korthals closed so that the US lead was only 9/10ths of a second by the exchange. The third US swimmer, Jeff Float, also went out quickly and had 3 seconds on the Germans at 500 metres, but Alexander Schowtka reeled in Float on the second 100, with the margin 1.56 seconds as the anchor swimmers started their work.
GroÃ anchored Germany, as expected, and he faced off against American Bruce Hayes. At the first turn of the anchor, GroÃ had caught up, but Gambril later noted that âGroÃ paid too much to catch Bruce that early.â For the next 100 they swam together, GroÃ unable to shake Hayes, until Germany took a slight lead at the final turn. With 25 metres to go, Hayes had made that up and they swam together to the wall, nobody really knowing who had won, until the scoreboard showed that it was the United States â 7:15.69 to 7:15.73 â the closest relay in Olympic swimming history. The time was a world record by over three seconds.
GroÃ was magnanimous in defeat, stating, âI simply did not have any more to give. We never expected to swim so fast in the relay, so we cannot be too disappointed.â His final leg of 1:46.89 was the fastest 200 split ever recorded at that time.

As a race, the final was decided on the first leg where Coughlin took a 11/2 second lead so the interest shifted to the question of how fast the Americans could swim and whether the final world record held by the East Germans would be deleted from the record books. The answer was in the affirmative as more than two seconds were sliced off the time of the GDR quartet. China were runners-up with Germany holding off a fast finishing Australia for bronze.

6195,"400 metres Freestyle, Men",1972 Summer Olympics,18,Swimming,01 September 1972,"Schwimmhalle, Olympiapark, MÃ¼nchen",43 from 28 countries,na,na,"The world record had been set by Kurt Krumpholz of the USA at a meet in Chicago in August 1972, but he had not made the US Olympic team. Krumpholz broke the record set by Brad Cooper at the Australian Olympic Trials in February 1972. Cooper was favored, along with young American Rick DeMont, who had won the US Olympic Trials, and was competing in Munich in both the 400 and 1,500. Also highly considered was Steve Genter, silver medalist in the 200 free, who had recovered from a collapsed lung in Munich to win that silver.
In the final Cooper took the lead through 200 metres, followed by Genter and American Tom McBreen, with DeMont a body length back in fourth place. But by 300 metres DeMont had moved up to Cooper shoulder, and caught him just before the final turn. Over the last lap there was nothing to choose and it was unclear who had won the race, but the electric timers have it to DeMont by 1/100th of a second â 4:00.26 to 4:00.27.
Or so it seemed. Two days later, DeMont swam his preliminary round heat in the 1,500 and qualified for the final of that event. And then came the news that he had tested positive for a banned substance and was disqualified from the 400 freestyle, and the 1,500 metres. Unlike many athletes who test positive, DeMont did not deny that he had taken Marax the night before his 400 metre races, but the reason was that Rick DeMont was an asthmatic and he regularly took Marax, and ephedrine derivative, to help control wheezing. When he had an attack in the Olympic Village he took a pill between 0100 and 0200 and took another pill the next morning. DeMont never hid the fact that he took the drug on a regular basis for his asthma, and had noted this on his medical form required of US athletes, but the United Statesâ team doctors had never checked to see if it contained any banned substances. Despite protests by United States officials, Rick DeMont was disqualified and Brad Cooper declared the winner of the 400 freestyle. When told of the final decision in Munich, Cooper said, âI donât want the medal.â
In 1996 DeMont sued the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) for having mishandled his situation in Munich. Among other things, it was alleged that the IOC offered to exonerate DeMont and led him keep the gold medal if the USOC would have the US team doctors accept responsibility for the error, but the USOC refused. In 2001 the USOC finally accepted responsibility and asked the IOC to restore DeMont gold medal but the IOC would not do so.
In 1973 Rick DeMont went to Belgrade, Yugoslavia for the 1st World Aquatics Championships. In the final of the 400 metre freestyle, he defeated Brad Cooper, breaking the world record and becoming the first swimmer to better four minutes for the 400 free, recording 3:58.18. He also won silver there in the 1,500. DeMont later became a swim coach at the University of Arizona and an accomplished artist.
Brad Cooper had a superb career, which has been marred by the controversy surrounding his Munich 400 gold medal. He won 18 Australian Championships, and at the 1972 World Aquatics Championships won silver behind DeMont in the 400 and a bronze in the 1,500. He competed in the 1974 Commonwealth Games, winning a gold in the 200 backstroke, silver in the 400 free, and a bronze in the 100 back, and then retired.
Steve Genter swam in Munich despite suffering collapsed lungs on first arriving in Germany and spending several days in the hospital, where he had to have thorax drained of fluid and air. He had already won silver in the 200 free and gold in the 4x200 relay by the time the 400 metre freestyle started. He finished third in the original race, and technically is listed as a silver medalist in the event, after the disqualification of DeMont. However, Genter thought that disqualification was unjust and never returned his bronze medal nor accepted a silver medal for the 400 metre freestyle.

He won relay gold medals at the 1993 European Championships, and then retired in 1996 after not making the Russian Olympic team for Atlanta.
Perkins would later win the 1,500 in Barcelona, defending that title in Atlanta, and add a 1,500 silver in Sydney.

Amazingly the qualifying heat was the first time that Smith had competed in an international race at the distance but she qualified in second place for the final. Missing from that final was Janet Evans, the American who had won the race in 1988 and finished second in 1992.  She failed to reach the final after finishing only ninth fastest in the heats.
Dutchwoman Carla Geurts set the pace in the final and led until the halfway mark when the faded out of contention. Smith then took the lead and burned away the rest of the pack over the third hundred. Dagmar Hase, the defending champion from Germany, closed in on Smith over the final stages but it was not enough to deny the Irishwoman her second title of the Games.

By the time of the Athens Games she had been long established as the best medley swimmer in the world but a new generation, led by 15-year-old Katie Hoff, were beginning to nip at her heels. Hoff came to Athens as world leader for 2004 but  failed to live up to her previous form as she finished 10 seconds off her best in her heat and well outside the qualifying positions.
Instead the challenge to Klochkova came from another American in the form of Kaitlin Sandeno. Sandeno had never broken 3:40.00 before Athens but, in the rarefied atmosphere of the Olympic final, she had the race of the life and took more than five seconds off her personal best to hound Klochkova almost into the final metres of the race. The Ukrainian held out to win over Sandeno by just 12 hundredths of a second with Georgina Bardach winning a rare swimming medal for Argentina, their first since 1936, in third.

But Hungary backstroke champion Krisztina Egerszegi threw a monkey wrench into the works at the 1991 Europeans when she swam this event for the first time internationally, and won gold at that meet. The final would come down to these three battling it out in one of the great IMs in history.
Sanders started it by leading on her specialty, the butterfly leg, but then Egerszegi surged ahead on her specialty, the backstroke, leading by over 11/2 seconds at 200 metres. Sanders went ahead again at the end of the breaststroke, as Lin closed on the duo. But Egerszegi had the most left. She took the lead just before the final turn and held it on the last lap to win the gold medal in 4:36.54. Lin also passed Sanders, finishing in 4:36.73, as Sandersâ bronze medal winning time of 4:37.58 was still six seconds ahead of fourth-placed Australian Hayley Lewis. The medal-winning times were the third, fourth, and fifth fastest performances of all-time, trailing only the world record from 1982 by East German Petra Schneider (4:36.10) and her 1980 Olympic winning time of 4:36.29.

Schneider dominance is underscored when one realizes that Davies mark of 4:46.83 made her the fourth fastest swimmer ever. The bronze medal went to Agnieszka Czopek, the first swimming medal ever won by a Polish swimmer.
Despite this era of simon-pure amateurism, David Wallechinsky describes in The Complete Book of the Olympics that Schneider later revealed that she had received 20,000 East German marks for her victory, while Davies was stripped of her amateur for receiving $40 for appearing on a television program.

But by 1984 she had been surpassed by the East Germans, notably Petra Schneider, the 1980 Olympic champion in this event, the current world record holder, and the 1982 World Champion in both IMs. Without the East Germans in Los Angeles there was no competition for Caulkins. She won the gold by 15 metres, and over nine seconds, recording 4:39.24 â approaching Schneider, who had won in Moscow by over 10 seconds.
Trailing in second place here was Australian Suzie Landells who had barely qualified for the final, placing eighth by 1/100th of a second. In 1986 Landells won both IMs at the Commonwealth Games. Another surprise in Los Angeles was the bronze medalist, Petra Zindler of West Germany. Her best time in 1984 was only 4:52.38, but she qualified third fastest and matched that in the final, improving to 4:48.57.
At the Friendship Games, three weeks hence, this event was won by Soviet swimmer Yelena Dendeberova in 4:43.78, well off Caulkinsâ Olympic winning time, and trailed by East German Kathleen Nord, who Caulkins considered her biggest rival in 1984, but who swam poorly to finish in 4:49.49.

Another contender was Michelle Smith of Ireland, who had placed second to Egerszegi at the 1995 European Championships, in addition to having won two gold medals at the meeting. History was not on Smith side as no Irish swimmer had ever won a race at the Olympic Games - let alone qualify for a final. Smith ended that streak by winning heat three and progressing as third fastest qualifier. The Irishwoman then went to win the final with comparative ease and finished three seconds ahead of Wagner with Egerszegi a close third.
Not only was Smith win the first by a Irish swimmer it was also the first time an Irish female Olympian had won any kind of medal in the history of the Games. Still there were many critics who saw her development from also-ran to world beater with a degree of suspicion. Smith had competed at two previous Olympics without ever getting past the heat stages and had only began achieving success after meeting Erik de Bruin, a Dutch discus thrower who was serving a ban for a doping violation, and her future husband.
Her supporters would point to the fact that de Bruin had revolutionized her training regime but there were always whispers that her performances were only achieved due to illegal methods. Smith won two more European titles in 1997, before her career came to a sudden halt in January 1998. In an out-of-competition drug test, she handed in a urine sample that had enough whiskey in it to kill a normal human being. This was considered enough evidence to convict her of tampering with the sample and she was banned for four years. After the ban ended she did not return to competition but instead qualified as a lawyer.

But her form in 2016 had not been quite as strong, so there was some daylight for the other swimmers. Other medal challengers were considered to be Americans Maya DiRado and Elizabeth Beisel and Spain Mireia Belmonte.
HosszÃº may have been sandbagging or simply training through competitions, as she returned to form in Rio, winning this event by almost five seconds over DiRado, in the world record time of 4:26.36, as Belmonte took bronze. HosszÃº came to Rio having won 56 international medals, but never an Olympic medal. She would win three golds and four medals in Rio, also winning the 200 IM and the 100 backstroke. DiRado took bronze in the 200 IM but defeated HosszÃº in the 200 backstroke to win that gold medal, adding another gold in the 4x200 free relay.

The defending gold medalist was Australian Steph Rice, but Beisel now had her number. Beisel had the fastest qualifier with 4:31.68 but was followed closely by surprising Chinese swimmer Ye Shiwen, who posted 4:31.73. It was surprising because her PR coming into London was only 4:33.55 from October 2011 and she had improved dramatically within the last year.
The final saw the lead exchanged several times with Hungarian Katinka HosszÃº leading on the butterfly and backstroke legs, but Beisel took over on the breaststroke, only to see Ye pass her just before the final stroke change. The final freestyle was all Ye, who came home in 58.68, with the final 50 done in a stunning 28.93, for a world record 4:28.43. This was the first individual world record since the skinsuit era, and was over a second better than Rice world record set in winning this event in Beijing. Beisel took silver, while Ye teammate Li Xuanxu came home for the bronze, HosszÃº finishing fourth, with Rice back in a tie for fourth with American Caitlin Leverenz.
Ye victory was not without some controversy, as her finish was stunning, but some thought it was âtoo goodâ. In his 400 IM gold medal on the same night, Ryan Lochte had finished in only 58.65 for the final 100, and Ye actually outswam him on the final 50, as he posted 29.10. Several American coaches and officials openly said that Ye mark had to be performance enhanced, though she passed all her drug tests, and the IOC actually had to come to Ye defense in a press release. It was redolent of the 1976 Olympics when Shirley Babashoff made similar comments about the East German female swimmers, allegations which in that case were eventually proven to be true.

There were no heats, as the thirteen runners started together, with twelve men on the line, and one, unknown soul forced to start behind the front line.  Herman Groman went into the lead at 70 metres, and quickly opened a gap.  The field immediately sorted itself out into two groups.  At 200 metres Hillman, who had been running third, took the lead, while Joseph Fleming left the second pack and joined the main group.  Into the last turn, George Poage tried to pass but was cut off by Fleming and Frank  Waller.  The final sprint involved Hillman, Waller, Groman, Fleming and Meyer Prinstein, as Poage fell back.  Hillman powered ahead to win by about three yards over Waller, with Groman on Waller heels and Fleming and Prinstein finishing almost together, another two yards back.
Though Percival Molson failed to place, he would achieve his fame later, but it would cost him his life.  Molson, the great-grandson of John Molson, founder of Molson Breweries of Canada, attended McGill, from which he graduated in 1900, after serving as president of his senior class and gaining every athletic honor the university could offer.  When World War I broke out, he joined the Princess Patricia Canadian Light Infantry, and fought for them at the Battle of Mount Sorrel in 1916.  He was wounded during the battle and returned home, receiving the Military Cross for his efforts.  He insisted he be allowed to rejoin the company and on 5 July 1917, while fighting on the outskirts of Avion, France, he was hit by mortar fire while attempting to rescue a fallen friend.  Both were killed.  In his honor, the main athletic stadium at McGill University is known as the Percival Molson Memorial Stadium.

On the second leg, Mirja Hietamies was surprisingly able to gain 18 seconds on Alevtina Kolchina and was only six seconds behind at the exchange. Anna-Lisa Eriksson brought Sweden to the heels of Norway, only one second back, but the two teams were already over two minutes behind the leaders and out of contention for the gold medal. The final leg developed into a thrilling duel between Siiri Rantanen of Finland and the Soviet Radiya Yeroshina. Rantanen caught Yeroshina early and took over the lead, but Yeroshina fought back and regained the lead. In the final stage of the race Rantanen was the strongest, passing Yeroshina 1,800 metres from the finish, and won a most surprising gold medal, 27 seconds ahead of the USSR. Sweden bronze medalist from the individual race, Sonja EdstrÃ¶m, had no problems, recording the fastest leg of the competition, and overtaking Norway Rakel Wahl to take the bronze, over a minute ahead of the Norwegian team.

The crash took out the best riders in St. Louis in 1904, notably Marcus Hurley, Burton Downing, Teddy Billington, and Oscar Goerke.  It was noted, however, that they deserved this somewhat because they rode near the end of the pack for much of the race, and thus were susceptible to a crash.  The crash occurred on the penultimate lap when McCrea swerved into the rider alongside him and they struck two other riders.  Hurley, Downing, Billington and Goerke were behind them and fell over the fallen riders.

In third, Ireland John Daly and Sweden Edward Dahl were neck-and-neck coming down the final stretch.  Daly weaved in and out several times, effectively preventing Dahl any chance to pass him.

Two heats of 9 skaters were drawn, the four best in each qualifying for the final. Both heats were boring affairs, skated at a slow pace, resulting in times of 9.51.6 and 10.01.4. All medal candidates qualified, except for Ossi Blomqvist of Finland, who placed 5th in the first race, which saw Alex Hurd (CAN), Shozo Ishihara (JPN), and Tomeju Uruma (JPN) fall.
The final, too, got off slowly, none of the skaters wanting to take the lead. This resulted in a scene similar to a team pursuit, with the leading skater swerving to the side at each turn. Only in lap 9 the skaters began to pick up the pace, but the eight kept together. With a lap and a half to go, the pack was lead by Eddie Murphy of the United States, ahead of Harry Smyth, Frank Stack, and Ivar Ballangrud. As they swung wide, fifth skater Irving Jaffee jumped away into the gap. Bernt Evensen followed him, but was then elbowed by Smyth. Evensen nearly fell, thereby obstructing his teammate Ballangrud. With both Norwegians off course, only Murphy managed to cling on to Jaffee. He remained in Jaffee tracks until the latter finally pulled away 10 yards before the finish. With Smyth awaiting a likely Norwegian protest, the Canadians filed a protest against Eddie Murphy, who supposedly had pushed Smyth, causing him to obstruct Ballangrud and Evensen. American referee Joseph K. Savage did not uphold the protest, and Jaffee was presented with the gold medal, Murphy taking silver and Willy Logan the bronze.
After four years, Irving Jaffee finally took revenge for the 1928 Olympics. A son of Russian immigrants, the New York skater contested his only international event in Sankt Moritz. After a 4th in the 5000 m, he was leading the 10000 m before it was annulled due to thawing ice conditions. Jaffee would not enjoy his gold medals for long, having to pawn them a few years later. The pawn shop itself went out of business, and the prizes were never recovered.

Using unorthodox training methods, such as ultrarunning, he made a comeback in the 2020/21 season, and with a huge impact. At the 2021 World Single Distance Championships held in the Heerenveen COVID-19 âbubbleâ, he won both 5,000 and 10,000 m, the latter in world record time.

The Swede produced a very evenly paced race, racing all his laps between 28.97 and 29.33 seconds, but up until the bell, he was trailing Roest times.

The Norwegian laid down a very âflatâ race, and had the advantage of being able to skate towards his pairmate, Aleksander Mitt, who was nearly a lap behind at the finish. Ballangrud finishing time was just 2 seconds above the World Record. Three races later, the runner-up of the World Championships, Wasenius, took the ice against Jan Langedijk, of the Netherlands.

Cheered on by his compatriots, he skated the best race of his life with 6:42.68. This seemed beatable by 1993 World Champion Falko Zandstra, but he faded badly late in the race and ended at 6:44.58. Then, it was Koss, who started with his own world record schedule in mind. Skating incredibly flat - all laps were between 30.86 and 32.01 - Koss beat his own mark by half a second: 6:34.96.

The race, originally set for a 1030 start was rescheduled to 0845, a change that was not announced to all spectators. The first surprise of the race was the fall of 1936 1,500 m champion Charles Mathiesen, who was out of shape and retired. After Dutchmen Jan Langedijk and Kees Broekman both went below 8.40, Hedlund went off for a very fast start. He slowed considerably during the last laps, but lowered the top mark to 8.34,8.
The most interesting pair of the competition was that between Lundberg and Harry Jansson (Sweden). Like Hedlund, Jansson went off quick, with Lundberg trailing for most of the race. At three laps, the Norwegian took command and also built up a lead on Hedlund, finishing after 8.32,7. Jansson, who had been slower than Hedlund for the entire race came very close to beating his compatriot, finished quickly and missed out by only one tenth of a second. In the 14th pair, Seyffarth was hoped to join his compatriots in the top-3, but he failed. This was partially due to a brush with a photographer, who had stepped onto the ice.

The only contender left was Lassi Parkkinen, but his chances were ruined by heavy snowfall start right after Liaklev pair.

At their Davos training races, Julius Skutnabb (8:50.4) and Clas Thunberg (8:51.9) had recorded the fastest times of the season. Three of the four Norwegians in competition also had sub-9 minute performances listed, all skated at a Frogner meet shortly before the Olympics, World Record holder Harald StrÃ¸m being the fastest with 8:52.3.
The second competition of the day got underway with the first two pairs being rescheduled due to non-starters. Charlie Gorman and LÃ©on Quaglia were the first to hit the ice. Quaglia had won the French Championships at the same rink two weeks earlier, and he improved on his performance in the 5000 m by more than 15 seconds: 9.08.6. The first to go under 9 minutes was Frithjof Paulsen of Norway, followed by his compatriot Harald StrÃ¸m who listed 8:54.6. StrÃ¸m time was good, considering that he had caught the flu on the previous day. As the Norwegian flag bearer, he had been out in the rain for hours wearing nothing but his race outfit.
The strongest North American distance skater, Val Bialas was coupled with Julius Skutnabb, and delivered an interesting fight, won by the 34-year-old Finn who also improved the season best time to 8:48.4. His teammate Thunberg did not have such a strong competitor in his race, but that did not stop him from outclassing the rest of the field with 8:39.0. The two remaining Norwegians, Larsen and Sigurd Moen, both delivered fine performances, but were also unable to approach the leading Finnish duo.
Thunberg was one of the dominant speed skaters of the era. He only started skating at age 20, but managed to win 5 World Championships and 4 European titles. One of his nicknames was âThe Nurmi of the iceâ, which he considered somewhat insulting, as he thought Paavo Nurmi might as well be called the âThunberg of the trackâ.

He had already set 15 world records in his career, and was World Champion in 1970-71 and European Champion in 1970 and 1972. Schenk was trying to win all four races in Sapporo, although he was considered a longshot in the 500 m, but he was the current world record holder in the 5,000 with 7:12.0.
Schenk started in the first pair, while it was snowing. Although it would later stop, the snow seemed not to bother him, as he posted 7:23.61, to win easily. Norway Roar GrÃ¸nvold was in the third pair and would finish almost five seconds back of Schenk, in 7:28.18, but it was good for the silver medal. The bronze went to Norway Sten Stensen, another five seconds back in 7:33.39. Schenk and GrÃ¸nvold were helped by the conditions as the ice was in poor condition after the fourth pair, due to poor ice preparation.
Schenk eventually won three gold medals in Sapporo, all except the 500, matching the feats of Clas Thunberg in 1924, Ivar Ballangrud in 1936, and Hjalmar Andersen in 1952. In his career, Schenk set 18 world records, won eight major international tournaments, and numerous distance titles. He was awarded the Oscar Mathisen Trophy in 1970, 1971, and 1972, and is considered one of the greatest speed skaters of all-time. Schenk briefly skated a short-lived professional circuit after the 1972 Winter Olympics, which lasted only 11/2 seasons.

A strong distance skater, he had been silver medalist in the 10,000 at Cortina. The world record was held by Boris Shilkov, who was the defending champion, but did not compete at Squaw Valley. At the World Championships, the 5,000 had been won at the recent 1960 meet by Soviet skater Valery Kotov and in 1959 by Dutch skater Jan Pesman, and both appeared for the race. A few days before the event, in a pre-Olympic meet in Squaw Valley, Pesman had won the distance with Johannesen second.
High winds hampered the race. The favorites were drawn late among the 37 starters, the first to go off Johannesen in the ninth pair. The leader at the time was his teammate, Torsten Seierstein, with 8:05.3. Johannesen was behind his pace almost throughout, but caught up on the final laps, and finished much more strongly, crossing in 8:00.8 to take the lead. Pesman was the next favorite up, in the 11th pair, alongside Soviet skater Viktor Kosichkin. Pesman skated well, and would eventually win the bronze medal, with a time of 8:05.1. But he was crushed by Kosichkin, who was not unknown, having placed second at the distance at the 1959 European Championships and third at the recent 1960 Worlds. He started behind Seierstein pace until 2,600 metres, but then reeled off metronymic 37-38 second laps to the end, winning easily with 7:51.3, over nine seconds ahead of Johannesen. A few days later, in the 10,000, Johannesen would win with Kosichkin second. Together they would fight several battles in the longer distances over the years, with Kosichkin winning the all-around at the 1961 European and 1962 World Championships.

They had taken seven medals in the past three editions, including all titles. But world record holder, defending Olympic Champion and 1999 and 2000 World Champion Gianni Romme had been ill at the Dutch trials, and had not made the team. Reigning World Champion Bob de Jong did qualify, but performed very poorly in Salt Lake City, finishing 30th in a field of 32. This left Carl Verheijen, runner-up at the 2001 Worlds, and the relatively unknown Jochem Uytdehaage, who had captured the European Championships in January. Apart from the Dutch, most was expected from the Norwegians. Their team contained the only non-Dutchman to have medalled in a World Cup earlier that season: Eskil Ervik.
The Olympic Record from 1998 was first broken in pair five. Yet it wasnât Nagano medalist Bart Veldkamp who did so, but his pairmate Jens Boden. The German was virtually unknown, and had never done any better than an 11th spot in a 5,000 m World Cup. His 6:21.73 in Salt Lake City turned out to be enough for a bronze medal, however. After this upset performance, Boden again settled into anonymity, never again approaching his Olympic medal achievement. The first man to beat Boden time was also unexpected. A convert from inline skating, Derek Parra had been a medal hope for the 1,500 m, but not in this event, having placed 15th at the most recent World Championships. But Parra race was excellent, skating with slightly increasing lap times the entire race to beat Romme world record. His 6:17.98 only lasted for a few pairs, however. Jochem Uytdehaage started out faster than the American, yet was able to keep the pace. In the end, he was more than 3 seconds ahead of the American, lowering the world record to 6:14.66.

Johannesen had won the distance at the recent 1964 European Championships, while Kosichkin was the 1962 World All-Around Champion and won the distance, and the all-around, at the 1961 Europeans. The world record holder was Sweden Jonny Nilsson, with 7:34.3 set in February 1963 at Karuizawa, Japan, and he was also considered a threat as he had won the 1963 World Championships, and won the 5K in the process.
In the third pair, lightly considered Austrian Hermann Strutz broke the Olympic record with 7:48.3 to take the early lead. In the next pair, Kosichkin recorded 7:45.8 to move ahead. The fifth pair had Norway Per Ivar Moe, who came across in 7:38.6, the second fastest time ever recorded. Jonny Nilsson was up in the seventh pair but his 7:48.4 would earn him only sixth place. In the 14th pair Johannesen was well behind Moe pace at 3,000 metres but came on strongly to finish in 7:48.7 â or that was the time flashed on the scoreboard. But a few seconds later, it was changed to Johannesen official time of 7:38.4, which earned him the gold medal. The Norwegian medal sweep was the first ever in men Olympic speed skating, and only the second at that time, following a Soviet sweep in the women 500 metres only six days before. On Austrian television, Strutz was initially announced as the silver medalist. After the error was corrected a viewer from Vienna sent a valuable gold coin to the television station, who presented it to Strutz as consolation.

In a World Cup race in late 2007, Torino bronze medallist Enrico Fabris had beaten him in world record time, only to see Kramer regain the mark a week later. As the three-time World Champion, world record holder and current World Cup leader, Kramer was the overwhelming favorite for this event.
Kramer was the first of the top skaters to race. On the tough Richmond ice, he narrowly beat the Olympic record dating from 2002, setting 6:14.60. As Kramer had predicted a winning time of 6:11, he was uncertain about this performance getting off the ice. The next race saw team mate Bob de Jong take the stage against Lee Seung-Hun of South Korea. The 2006 champion in the 10,000 m, De Jong was expected to fight for the medals, but instead he was soundly beaten by Lee. The 2008 short track World Champion, Lee had switched to long track when he was no longer selected for the national team. He had seen some top-10 performances during the season, but his 6:16.95 race in Richmond came as an upset.
The thirteenth pair saw Fabris race Ivan Skobrev. The Russian had been training with Fabris under the Italian coach, Maurizio Marchetto, in an effort to strengthen the Italian team. It had given Skobrev his first international medals, while Fabris had won an impressive World Cup victory earlier in the season. Both skaters were ahead of Lee splits for most of the race, but had to pay for their fast starts in the end. Skobrev less so than Fabris, finishing in 6:18.05. This meant a bronze medal, as the runner-up of the 2009 Worlds, HÃ¥vard BÃ¸kko (Norway) was off-pace for the entire race and placed fourth. Having won the coveted gold medal, Kramer climbed into the stands to meet his family, including father Yep Kramer, a former Olympian, and girlfriend Naomi van As, an Olympic champion in field hockey.
Back in 20th place was Haralds Silovs from Latvia. Not only was he the first male Latvian speed skater to compete in the Olympics since 1936, he also was the first Olympian to compete in both long track and short track speed skating at the same Games. More impressively, he did so on the same day, racing in the 1,500 m at the Pacific Coliseum after completing his 5,000 m at Richmond.

He had won every international championship in which he competed from 1950-52, then briefly retired only to return in 1954. He had won the 5 and 10K at the 1954 European Championships, but he was no longer the dominant skater he had been. The other most recent major titles at the distance had been won by Norwegian Knut Johannesen at the 1955 Worlds, Sweden Sigge Ericsson at the 1955 Europeans, and Soviet skater Oleg Goncharenko at the 1954 Worlds, who had only recently won an international meet in Davos. But also highly considered was another Soviet, Boris Shilkov, who had won the 1954 European and Worlds all-around, and had set the world record of 7:45.6 in 1955 at Medeo, bettering the previous record by 18 seconds.
Shilkov was the first favorite to start, in the fourth pair, and the mark he had to shoot at was 8:00.2 set up by the Netherlandsâ Wim de Graaff. Shilkov started quickly, with by far the fastest split at 1,000 m among the contenders, and he finished just as strongly, crossing the line in 7:48.7, the second fastest time ever. The gold medal was his and nobody would approach his time, as he won by a full eight seconds. Goncharenko was next up among the contenders, but finished the sixth pair in 7:57.5, which was eventually good enough for the bronze medal. The silver went to Ericsson, skating in the eighth pair, who posted 7:56.7. But everybody held their breath as the 11th pair started, with Hjalmar Andersen. But he finished in 8:06.5 and would place only 11th.

His biggest competition was expected to come from the Norwegian, Kai Arne Stenshjemmet. Stenshjemmet was the world record holder, with 6:56.9, set at Medeo in March 1977. He had been third at the 1979 World All-Around, and fourth in 1978, and was better at longer distances. Norway Tom Erik Oxholm started in the first pair and recorded 7:05.59, a mark for Heiden to shoot at in the second pair. Skating with Dutchman Hilbert van der Duim, Heiden was two seconds in front after 41/2 laps, and defeated van der Duim by over five seconds, posting 7:02.29. It gave Stenshjemmet a goal and he set his lap times accordingly. Thru 10 laps he was ahead of Heiden pace, but at 4,200 metres he trailed by 1/100th of a second, and that was it. He had little left, and fell back a full second on the last two laps. Heiden had his second gold, but Stenshjemmet did hang on for the silver medal, with Oxholm getting bronze.

European Champion in 1950, 1951 and 1952, and World Champion in 1950 and 1951 (the â52 title would follow after the Olympics), he had won the 5,000 m at each of these championships. In 1951, he had also broken the world record and lowered it to 8.07,3. In January 1952, that time had been bested by Nikolay Mamonov, who had used 8.03,7 at the Kazakh Championships held at Medeo. But that time would not be officially recognized as a world record until 1955, and Mamonov did not compete in Oslo either.
With a light freeze, the ice conditions in Bislett were excellent. Andersen, departing in the third pair against Wim van der Voort, started eagerly. In a clean race with slightly increasing lap times, Andersen set a time of 8.10,6 just seconds away from his own world record, but beating both the track and Olympic record. The gold medal seemed secured already for Andersen.
At the recent European Championships, Andersen had won the 5,000 m by some 13 seconds over Kees Broekman and KornÃ©l Pajor. Pajor was not allowed to compete in Oslo, but Broekman was. Starting two pairs after Andersen, it was immediately clear that he would not threaten the leader. A steady race left Broekman exactly 11 seconds behind first place. Several other medal candidates were still to come after Broekman. At the pre-Olympic Hamar competition, Pentti Lammio had finished second behind Broekman, while Sverre Haugli was disqualified there; he had finished second behind Andersen at the Norwegian Championships. Haugli skated first, and was faster than the Dutch skater for much of the race. Their split times in the last part of the race were close, and Haugli only lost the silver medal in the last lap, finishing 8 tenths behind Broekman. Lammio then had a similarly fast start, but blew up in the remaining laps. Of the remaining skaters, Anton Huiskes (Netherlands) was the only one to beat 8.30, but he finished well clear of the medals. The silver medal won by his team mate Broekman was the first Dutch speed skating medal won at the Olympics.

Not only had he beaten Johann Olav Koss world record, set in the 1994 Olympics, he had also won two of the three World Cup races that year, the third one being won by Kjell Storelid, runner-up in 1994. In Nagano, Romme was mostly expected to battle his own teammates (Rintje Ritsma and Bob De Jong), and his former compatriot, Bart Veldkamp.
Veldkamp was the first of the favorites to skate. Olympic Champion for the Netherlands in 1992, he had assumed Belgian nationality to avoid the tough Dutch selection races and automatically qualify for international competition. In Nagano, Veldkamp broke Romme world record, becoming the first person to go below 6:30 with 6:28.31. The next pair included the reigning World Champion, Rintje Ritsma. He started out faster than Veldkamp, gaining more than a second, but lost ground towards the end, finishing with only 0.07 seconds left on the Belgian.
Ritsma time was still on top as the final pair with Romme and Storelid got underway. Romme set out with an insane pace, having a 2-seconds lead on Ritsma after only 1,000 m. Romme managed to keep up the pace, and eventually outraced Ritsma by a full six seconds, eight seconds below his own former best, shattering the previous world record. Just a month later, Romme would again shave off 8 tenths from his mark at the World Single Distance Championships in Calgary.

When he finished in 7:12.28, far from Aleksandr Baranov world record of 6:45.66, and almost 10 seconds slower than Eric Heidenâs Olympic record, he did not think the time would be good enough for the podium. But it held up for two pairs. In the fourth pair, Igor Malkov set a fast pace, and was over a second ahead of Gustafson at 4,200 metres. But he faded badly on the final two laps, barely finishing behind the Swede, in 7:12.30. Malkov pairmate, East German Andreas Ehrig, was also ahead of Gustafson pace at 4,200 metres, but was hardly able to finish the race, crossing in 7:17.63, his last lap almost four seconds slower than Gustafson. In the seventh pair, Ehrig East German teammate, RenÃ© SchÃ¶fisch, skated more reasonably, and finished in 7:17.49, which would win him the bronze medal. This was completely unexpected, as previously he had only won the 1983 GDR 5 and 10k championships.  In the end, Gustafson watched the entire field take a crack at his time, but nobody bettered it and he had a gold medal.

Verkerk was in the third pair, with no significant leading time to shoot at. He was ahead of world record pace throughout and finished in 7:23.2, surpassing Maier world record. Two pairs later Maier toed the line. He crept ahead of Verkerk pace at 1,800 m, and was three seconds clear at 3,800 metres.

In the 2013-2014 season, Kramer had won all 5,000 m races he contested, including two World Cup races. Kramer biggest competitor seemed to be teammate Jorrit Bergsma, silver medalist at the 2013 World Championships and winner of the third 5,000 m World Cup race in the running season. The 2011 World Champion Bob de Jong had missed the Dutch team, but his âreplacementâ Jan Blokhuijsen had placed second in the most recent World Cup. Outside of the Dutch team, 2010 medallists Lee Seung-Hun and Ivan Skobrev were still highly considered, while the Belgian inline convert Bart Swings was considered to have a shot at a medal as well.
The first top favorite to hit the ice, Sven Kramer battered the leading time of Denis Yuskov. In a stable race, he beat his own track record and the Olympic Record by four seconds: 6:10.76. This time seemed unapproachable, but Bergsma made a brave attempt. Staying within reach of Kramer time until 3,800 m, he lost pace in the remaining laps, landing at 6:16.66. Blokhuijsen and Swings, in pair 12, started a little more carefully. At 3,400 m, Swings had to let Blokhuijsen go, who overtook Bergsma time at the bell.

But the Norwegian was unable to keep the pace. He was eventually passed by his opponent, Michael Hadschieff, and finished seventh. Visser teammate, Gerard Kemkers, also started faster in the first half of the race, but did not fade like Karlstad, and finished only one second behind the leading time. In the ninth pair, Gustafson was the last medal contender to skate. He trailed Visser time for the entire race, and with one lap to go, Gustafson was 0.87 behind Visser, and even slightly behind Kemkers. But the Swede delivered an incredible final lap with 31.86 seconds (compared to Visser 33.08), and he moved up from bronze medal position to gold.

As the race progressed, wind and snow grew stronger, and ice conditions deteriorated. This placed the skaters who had been drawn late in the competition at a disadvantage. The first favorite to hit the ice was Ivar Ballangrud. The 24-year-old Norwegian was the 1926 World Champion, and had won the 5 km race at the World Championships in Davos just a week ago. He took great advantage of the weather conditions in his race, skating a steady race and lapping his Lithuanian opponent. His time of 8:50.5 was a far cry from the times skated in Davos, where Ballangrud had approached the World Record (which stood at 8:26.5).
Bernt Evensen took off faster than Ballangrud, and had the fastest time until two-thirds of the race, when he faded and finished ten seconds behind his countryman. His time was approached by the best American distance skater, Irving Jaffee of New York. He gained on Evensen every lap, but ended up 0.2 seconds short. 38-year-old Finnish veteran Julius Skutnabb had a similar build up, but won two seconds on the Norwegian in the final lap, moving into silver medal position.
By then, weather conditions had become really tough. Norwegian Armand Carlsen came within half a second of the bronze medal, and would likely have medalled had it not been for the snow. Other favorites finished further back, including two 5000 m medalists from the recent World Championships, Michael Staksrud (NOR) and Clas Thunberg (FIN).

Even in the 2017/2018 season, Kramer had won both World Cups he contested. But some challengers to his dominance had appeared. At the Dutch Olympic Trials, Kramer was surprisingly defeated by Bob de Vries. And in the Calgary World Cup, his world record was taken by Ted-Jan Bloemen. Bloemen, who had raced for Netherlands through 2014, had since switched allegiance to Canada on account of his father dual citizenship. Further medal contenders were Norway Sverre Lunde Pedersen, winner of the Erfurt World Cup, New Zealand Peter Michael, bronze medalist at the 2017 Worlds, and Jan Blokhuijsen, 2014 silver medallist.
The race started with home favorite and 2010 silver medalist, Lee Seung-Hun, racing 6:14.15, a time then pipped by Michael with 6:14.07. The following pair then saw an exciting duel between Bloemen and Pedersen. The Canadian started faster, then briefly faded and he was eclipsed by the Norwegian after 3,000 m. Bloemen then fought back and bridged a one-second gap in the final to laps to cross the finish line at the same time. Examination of the photo finish was needed to determine that Bloemen had edged out Pedersen by a mere 0.002. Kramer, who had noticed all contenders had started out fast and had faded a little in the end, then used the opposite strategy in his race. Trailing by 1.6 seconds at the halfway mark, Kramer low 29-second laps then quickly moved him into the fastest time. His 6:09.76 at the finish meant a new Olympic Record, bettering his own mark from four years prior. His third gold in a row made Kramer the first person to win the 5,000 m gold three times, and the first male speed skater to produce a âthreepeatâ, after Bonnie Blair and Claudia Pechstein.

1077,"5,000 metres, Men",1992 Winter Olympics,44,Speed Skating,13 February 1992,"Anneau de Vitesse, Albertville",36 from 20 countries,na,na,"Based on the results earlier in the season, there were three favorites for the gold. These three had occupied the podium places at all four international races held thusfar. At the first World Cup, Johann Olav Koss was the winner. But the Norwegian world record holder had suffered an inflamed pancreas just days before the Olympic 5,000 m. While he had recovered, his form was unknown. Koss compatriot Geir Karlstad had won the other two World Cup races in the season. Karlstad was looking for revenge for the 1988 Olympics, where he had performed disappointingly with a seventh place (and a fall in the 10,000 m). The third contender was Bart Veldkamp of the Netherlands, who won the 5,000 m at the European Championships.
Due to rainfall, it was expected the race would be postponed like earlier Olympic races in Albertville. This time, the referees decided to start as planned. That meant the first pairs were skated on very soft ice, hampering the early starters. This mostly hit Koss, who recorded 7:11.32 (seventh) and Veldkamp, who finished in 7:08.00 (fifth). After the first ice preparation, conditions became better. Young Dutchman Falko Zandstra took advantage of this, skating 7:02.28, beating his compatriot Leo Visser, the Olympic runner-up of 1988. But his time was no match for Geir Karlstad. The established long distance skater set off faster than Zandstra, and never looked back. His 6:59.97 was good enough to become the first Norwegian to win Olympic speed skating gold since 1976.
Prior to the Games, newspapers had revealed that Karlstad carried around a letter from Norwegian doctors, stating his body produced high levels of testosterone, close to the maximum allowed epi-testosterone - testosterone ratio of 1:6. Karlstad supposedly handed out this letter at doping controls, but various officials from the IOC and ISU attested that such a letter would not absolve Karlstad in case of an infringement. This was naturally brought up again after Karlstad win, but he passed doping tests without exceeding any limits, as he had done on all previous occasions.

It was essentially a club contest, with the Racing Club de France taking on a team from the Amateur Athletic Association (AAA) of Great Britain.  Competing for the AAA, to enable them to field a team, was the Australian sprinter, Stan Rowley.  He stopped running, however, and began walking after one lap.
Jack Rimmer led the field through 1,500 metres in 4:30.0, with Bennett in second, and the field bunched, save for Rowley.  The same two led at 3,000 metres, passed in 9:20.0, and at this point, Alfred Tysoe and Sidney Robinson lost contact, as did the Frenchmen, AndrÃ© Castanet, and Michel Champoudry.  In the next kilometre, the two Englishmen pulled away from the three leading Frenchmen, and passed 4,000 metres in 12:30.0.  On the last lap, Bennett moved up and lost Rimmer easily in the sprint to the finish, with the other runners finishing as below.
When Champoudry finished, in ninth place, Stan Rowley was finishing up his seventh lap.  The officials allowed him to stop at that point, and awarded him ten points for finishing in tenth place.

Apart from her Olympic title, the Czech star had won six consecutive World Championships in the 5,000 m (2007-9, 2011-13), and had won the season only World Cup race. Another former champion, Claudia Pechstein placed second at that World Cup. A nine-time Olympic medallist aged 41, she was hoping to add a record 10th medal to her collection. Despite not being a specialist in the event, Ireen WÃ¼st was seriously considered for a medal, having already claimed three medals in Sochi, and having finished second behind SÃ¡blÃ­kovÃ¡ at the 2013 Worlds. The Russian crowd was hoping that Olga Graf could replicate her bronze performance from the 3,000 m.
The first skater to beat 7 minutes was Carien Kleibeuker. A competitor in 2006, Kleibeuker had switched to the Dutch marathon skating circuit, but had decided to make one last attempt at Olympic success. Her 6:55.77 at least held off her pairmate Graf, who lost half a second in the final lap to finish only 0.11 behind the Dutchwoman. The 7th pair then saw SÃ¡blÃ­kovÃ¡ and WÃ¼st pitted against each other. As always, WÃ¼st departed fast, and held the lead through 3,800 m. SÃ¡blÃ­kovÃ¡ then powered past her rival, opening up a 2.74-second gap in the final three laps, to finish in 6:51.54. In the final pair, Claudia Pechstein kept up with the leader pace for about 6 laps, but then quickly fell back, dropping behind Kleibeuker with three laps left.

Prior to the Games, she might have feared stiff competition from compatriot, Anni Friesinger, winner of the only 5,000 m World Cup race earlier in the season. But Friesinger had not done well in the Olympic 3,000 m, while Pechstein had won that race.
Instead competition for Pechstein came from two women who had only recently picked up speed skating again. Canadian Clara Hughes had been a speed skater before choosing a cycling career that earned her two Olympic bronze medals in the 1996 Games. She had picked up her old sport again in 2001, and had set a time of 7.00,10 at the Canadian Olympic Trials. Gretha Smit had been the surprise of the Dutch Olympic Trials. Dominant in women marathon skating, she had taken a stab at long track skating, and had overwhelmingly won the 3,000 m and 5,000 m at the selection competition.
Skating in the first pair, Smit shattered Niemann world record, which had been set in March 2001, lowering it to 6:49.22. Only in the sixth pair did Hughes manage to approach the time with 6:53.53, mainly due to her steady final laps. Undaunted by these times, Pechstein set off faster than Smit. This appeared to have cost her, as she fell behind the Dutchwoman at 1,800 m and started to lose more time in the ensuing laps. The gap increased to 2.76 seconds at 3,400 m, but Smit final 33 and 34-second laps left room for improvement. Pechstein seized that opportunity, turning around her deficit at the bell to a sizable margin of victory at the finish line.

This did not come as a surprise â as the reigning World Champion, she had also won the season only 5,000 m World Cup race. Back in November 2021, in Stavanger (NOR), she had held off Isabelle Weidemann and Ragne Wiklund, two medal contenders. Also considered were world record holder Nataliya Voronina and 10-time world champion, and two-time Olympic champion, Martina SÃ¡blÃ­kovÃ¡.
Voronina was the first to beat seven minutes in the race, but her time of 6:56.99 didnât show any echoes of her marvelous world record and world title race in 2020 â it would eventually land her in seventh place. SÃ¡blÃ­kovÃ¡, the great Czech champion, had been less successful in recent years, having been plagued by recurring back injuries. In January 2022, she had a serious fall while training in Collalbo (ITA), requiring stitches in her thigh and missing the European Championships. Having just missed out on a medal in the 3,000 m, she delivered a very steady race now, delivering all 32-second (or faster) laps, leading to a 6:50.09 final time.
After a slightly slower start, Weidemann in pair five set out for a pace slightly faster each lap than SÃ¡blÃ­kovÃ¡ had been. Wiklund trailed the Canadian closely until about 3,000 m, but she faded quickly while the Weidemann ended in 6:48.18, guaranteeing her second medal of the Games after bronze in the 3,000 m. The other two 3K medalists once again faced-off in the final pair. Again, Francesca Lollobrigida took off quickly, while Schouten started a bit slower than SÃ¡blÃ­kovÃ¡. Before the halfway point, Schouten had passed Lollobrigida as well as SÃ¡blÃ­kovÃ¡ splits. Racing a ânegative splitâ, she recorded a faster second half of the race, bringing her well below the times of her rivals, finishing in 6:43.51, well below the 2002 Olympic Record.
For SÃ¡blÃ­kovÃ¡, her seventh medal made her the undisputed most successful Olympic athlete for the Czech Republic, beating out KateÅina NeumannovÃ¡ on gold medals won as well as total medals.

As the three-time World Champion and world record holder, SÃ¡blÃ­kovÃ¡ had little serious competition in the distance. But in the Olympic season, she got competition from a young German skater, Stephanie Beckert. While Beckert had not beaten SÃ¡blÃ­kovÃ¡ in the 5,000 m, she had done so twice in the 3,000 m, and Beckert was considered to be stronger in the longer event. A third title contender was the defending champion, Clara Hughes, who, at 37-years-old, was hoping to end her career with a gold medal in Vancouver, and her silver medals in the 2008 and 2009 World Championships showed this was not impossible.
Hughes skated as the first of the favorites. She recorded a very solid performance, with slowly increasing lap times, finishing in 6:55.73, a time that virtually ensured her of a medal. In pair seven, Beckert faced Kristina Groves, who also enjoyed medal hopes on virtue of three bronze medals at the past three World Championships in the 5,000 m. But Beckert soon left the Canadian behind her, and powered on to a new personal best: 6:51.39. This gave SÃ¡blÃ­kovÃ¡ a tough assignment, but she was up to the task. Although weakening somewhat in the final part, her gold medal was never really under threat, and she secured her third medal of the Games, and the second gold.

In over a decade, she had claimed 9 consecutive World Championships in the event, as well as the 2010 and 2014 Olympic titles (and a 4th place in 2006), and 11 consecutive long distance World Cups. She also bettered the world record twice, lowering it to 6:42.66 in 2011. But in the 2017/2018, SÃ¡blÃ­kovÃ¡ had struggled with her form, following a pre-season injury. In the event only appearance at the World Cup, in Stavanger, she did place third, with victory going to Claudia Pechstein. Although a 3-time Olympic champion in the event, Pechstein hadnât won a race internationally in three years and was 45 at the time. In 2017, though, she had finished second at the World Championships (behind SÃ¡blÃ­kovÃ¡). Third place there went to Canada Ivanie Blondin, who also came second in Stavanger.
The contest opened with Annouk van der Weijden of Netherlands with a sub-7 minute race, with 6:54.17, a personal best about 2 seconds slower than SÃ¡blÃ­kovÃ¡ track record. It held up through the first half of the field. She was first challenged by her compatriot, Esmee Visser. A surprise qualifier at the Dutch trials, she had won the inaugural European 3,000 m title earlier in the year. Visser trailed Van der Weijden time until halfway, then pulled away to a strong finish at 6:50.23, the fastest time at the Olympics since the high-altitude competition in Salt Lake City 2002. Both Pechstein and Blondin attempted to follow along with Visser splits, but lost touch after 2,600 m and faded to non-medal finishes. The final pair seemed to follow a similar pattern: SÃ¡blÃ­kovÃ¡ and Nataliya Voronina had the same split as Visser at 2,200 m, but then failed to keep up. However, SÃ¡blÃ­kovÃ¡ managed to limit damage, and kept within two seconds, crossing the line in 6:51.85. Behind her Voronina also hung on, beating Van der Weijden to the bronze by a few tenths. Visser, who had never raced an international 5,000 m event at senior level, was shocked and ecstatic at her victory - the first by a Dutch skater in the event since 1988. SÃ¡blÃ­kovÃ¡ second place made her the second Olympian for Czech Republic to win six medals, tying KateÅina NeumannovÃ¡.

The top favorite was Gunda Niemann-Stirnemann, who already had won the 3,000 m and was runner-up in the 1,500 m. With 7:03.26, Niemann held the World Record, and had won the 1997 World title and 1992 Olympic title. At the only international competition earlier in the season in Innsbruck, Niemann had also won, but she had beaten compatriot Claudia Pechstein by just 0.08. Pechstein had also surprisingly beaten Niemann at this distance at the 1994 Olympics, and was hoping for another upset. Third place was open to a number of contenders, including 1996 and 1997 World Championships runner-up Carla Zijlstra and Italian Elena Belci, having placed 3rd in Innsbruck.
Belci did not prove to be in great shape, and could do no better than 7:15.58. Of the Dutch women, it was not Zijlstra, but Barbara de Loor, who seemed headed for a medal, but she was beaten by the final lap of her opponent in the previous pair, Lyudmila Prokasheva. A strong distance skater from Kazakhstan, Prokasheva had been runner-up at the World Allround Championships in 1995. With her 7:11.14, she would capture the first Olympic speed skating medal for Kazakhstan. Her time was far behind the other two medalists, however.
Gunda Niemann was the first of the Germans to start. On a sound pace - her 3,000 m split would have placed her 4th in that event â she set out to break her own world record. She succeeded, en passant becoming the first woman to complete 5,000 m within 7 minutes: 6:59.65. With this assignment, Pechstein departed in the final pair. Initially slower than Niemann, Pechstein slowly came closer to the leader splits. At 3,400 m, she first surpassed Niemann, but her lead remained within a second. Having a 7-tenth lead, she went into the final lap. It appeared to be slower than Niemann, but Pechstein held out until the finish line, pushing her skate home in 6:59.61. Pechstein lost her world record a month later to Niemann, who shaved off a second at the World Championships in Calgary.

Additionally, she was the world record holder, having recorded 7:20.36 at Heerenveen in the previous season. Her main rival was thought to be Andrea Ehrig. Since the 5,000 m had been re-introduced in women allround skating in 1983, Ehrig had been the fastest in the distance in at all World Championships since then, and had not lost an international 5,000 m since 1985. Like Van Gennip, Ehrig had also medalled in the 1,500 m (bronze) and 3,000 m (silver).
As in the 3,000 m, Ehrig was the first to set a mark, starting in pair one. She was also the first to break the world record, as she had done in the 3,000 m. Her 7:17.12 was three seconds under the previous best, and was sufficient to keep Gabi Zange-SchÃ¶nbrunn behind her. Also a former world record holder, Zange narrowly beat her personal best (from the Calgary World Cup in December), posting 7:21.61. This left more than enough room for Van Gennip. Up until the half-way point, she kept equal with Ehrig, before slowly edging away from the East German. Van Gennip final time of 7:14.13 was nearly three seconds faster than Ehrig, and six seconds below her own former world record. After receiving her third gold medal, Van Gennip flew home, where a hero welcome awaited her.

Pechstein had medaled in the Olympic 5,000 m every time since 1992, winning it in 1994, 1998 and 2002. Her winning time in 2002 was also the world record, and she had additionally won the 2003 World Championships. Clara Hughes was a former cyclist, having medaled in the 1996 Olympics. Returning to her first sport, speed skating, she won a third Olympic bronze in that sport in 2002. An expert in the longest distance on the women programme, Hughes had won the World Championships in 2004.
Two other medal contenders were not skating in Torino. 2002 runner-up Gretha Smit had made the Dutch team, but could not race as Dutch performances in the Olympic 3000 m meant that only two Dutch skaters could race. Polish skater Katarzyna WÃ³jcicka later revealed she had been offered more than â¬40,000 to forfeit her place in the race in favor of Smit, although this was later denied by both Smit and her coach Ingrid Paul. The reigning World Champion, Anni Friesinger of Germany, was also missing from the starting list, citing exhaustion after four Olympic races.
The race followed the draw closely, with the best times coming from the last two pairs. The Czech flagbearer, junior skater Martina SÃ¡blÃ­kovÃ¡ had hoped to win her country first ever Olympic speed skating medal in her favorite event. She was pegged against Cindy Klassen, who had already won four medals during the Games, including a gold medal in the 1500 m. As expected, Klassen started very fast, leaving SÃ¡blÃ­kovÃ¡ far behind. The fast pace left Klassen exploding in the final laps, seeing her 5-second lead decrease rapidly in the last two laps. In the end, she managed to stay less than a second ahead of SÃ¡blÃ­kovÃ¡.
The final pair was one of the more exciting races of the Olympics. Pechstein sprinted away from known slow-starter Hughes. As both trailed Klassen fast split times, Hughes gradually picked up. At 4 km, Pechstein appeared to make a decisive move, but Hughes countered and first led the race at 4,600 m, albeit only by 0.15 seconds. With both skaters still two seconds behind Klassen time, Hughes outsprinted Pechstein for the gold, with the German finishing fast enough to also beat Klassen for the silver.

At the only international competition of the season, at the European Championships in Heerenveen, they had also placed in that order. Niemann had moreover won the distance at the past four European Championships, as well as the 1991 World Championships. At all tournaments, she had also taken the overall title. The world record holder was Yvonne van Gennip, with her winning time at the 1988 Olympics, but the Dutch skater had had poor showings in Albertville and withdrew from the 5,000 m due to a fever.
Warnicke started in pair three, racing against Carla Zijlstra of the Netherlands. Zijlstra had recently impressed with a third place in this distance at the European Championships, and was an outsider for a medal. She was no match for Warnicke, however, as the German quickly distanced herself from the Dutch skater. She finished in 7:37.59, versus 7:41.10 for Zijlstra. After an ice preparation, Niemann started. Taking advantage of the good conditions, she easily defeated her teammate and friend, with 7:31.57. Medals seemed divided, but the third German, Claudia Pechstein, still had to race. The 19-year-old had fallen at the longest distance in Heerenveen, but in Albertville she was in top shape. Chasing Zijlstra splits for the first half of the race, she opened a gap, increasing it to 1.3 seconds at the finish line. This gave the Germans a complete sweep of the medals. As in 1984, when German skaters won all medals in the 3,000 m, all three skaters were from East Germany. For Pechstein, her upset bronze medal would be the start of a successful Olympic career. She would win the 5,000 m in 1994, 1998 and 2002, scoring upset victories on the first two occasions.

Since her appearance in the Olympic 5,000 m of Calgary (1988), in which she placed 7th despite a fall, Niemann had not lost an international 5,000 m. She had won the distance at the 1989, 1991, 1992 and 1993 World Championships, the 1989-1994 Europeans, the 1992 Olympics, and in 8 World Cup events. To top off the list, she had obtained her latest World Cup victory on in Hamar in December 1993 by improving her own world record to 7:13.29.
As in the other Olympic events, things did not go Niemann way. First, her team mate, Claudia Pechstein set a surprisingly fast time. While a bronze medallist in 1992 and in the 1994 3,000 m, she had been ill earlier in the season, and with 7:33.58, her 5,000 m personal best was 20 seconds behind the world record. But after a very steady race, Pechstein time was 7:14.37, only a second from Niemann best. The next race, a second racer beat 7:20. It was Hiromi Yamamoto of Japan. Despite being the Asian champion in the event, she was virtually unknown. Her only pre-Olympic feat had been a second place in the 3,000 m at a January World Cup, although that competition lacked several top skaters. Her time of 7:19.68 would be enough for bronze. Niemann raced in pair six, and started off very fast. For 3,800 m, she was below her own world record schedule. But with lap times increasing, that time fell out of sight, while the gap with Pechstein splits got smaller. At 4,600 m, Niemann was one tenth slower than her team mate, and the gap grew even further to half a second in the final lap. Pechstein gold medal would turn out to be the first of three consecutive titles in the event for her, winning two more in 1998 and 2002. In 1992, she also won a bronze medal, and in 2006 Pechstein finished second, making for a total of 5 medals in the 5,000 m.
Of the other competitors, it appeared that Italian Elena Belci would be unable to compete. Like Niemann, she had been disqualified in the 3,000 m, and new rules required a place among the best 16 of the 3,000 m for starting places in the 5,000 m. After Poland and Romania forfeited a spot in favor of Italy, unsubstantiated rumors appeared of bribes by the Italians. Belci, considered a potential medalist, eventually finished fourth.

The margin of victory in that race had been 0.9 seconds, but because starting margins are rounded down to the lesser second, they started together. Yegorova would post the fastest freestyle time to win the gold medal in this event. The fourth starter, Stefania Belmondo, took the early lead in the freestyle section, but Yegorova moved ahead at 6.5 km and defeated her by over 24 seconds. Yelena VÃ¤lbe started third, having finished third in the 5 km, she posted the third fastest freestyle section, and won the bronze medal in this event as well. Lukkarinen dropped back to fouth place, with only the seventh fastest freestyle split. In 1993, Belmondo would win the inaugural World Championship in this event, with Yegorova placing third.

Rather the event was skied in two sections on the same day, with classical skied first, followed by the freestyle pursuit, both sections now over 5 km. The morning classical leg was won by Olga Danilova with her teammate Larisa Lazutina in second. They had a comfortable lead of over seven seconds on Slovenian Petra MajdiÄ. The Russians were not as strong in the freestyle, but still won the gold and silver medals easily, Danilova seven seconds ahead of Lazutina, who was 10 seconds ahead of Scott. The battle for the bronze was very close. Canada Beckie Scott had been sixth in the classical section, with Czech skier KateÅina NeumannovÃ¡ in eighth, trailing Scott by 10.1 seconds.

BjÃ¸rn DÃ¦hlie had already won two individual gold medals and was the defending champion. But he was always considered better in freestyle than classical, the style chosen for the 50 km in 1994. The other strongest skier of the past few years was Vladimir Smirnov, who had won the 1990-91 World Cup, and was in the process of winning again in 1993-94. But Smirnov always struggled in the 50 km, usually finishing poorly after good starts. He had won two silvers in Lillehammer but was not given much of a chance. The major contenders looked to be Russian Aleksey Prokurorov, the winner of the event at Holmenkollen in 1993, and Sweden Torgny Mogren, winner of the last two World Championships. But Sweden did not even nominate Mogren to start in the 50 km, leaving him for the 30 km, in which he placed 24th.
But something odd happened when the race was run. Smirnov started quickly and was second at the first checkpoint, but moved into the lead by the 7.8 km time check. He held that through 33.4 km, and then the strange occurrence came when, at the 47.1 km mark, he was still in the lead and skiing strongly. In fact, he had the best finish of any of the leaders, slowly down only in the last 3 kilometres when he had the race in hand, eventually winning by 1:21.6 over Finland Mika MyllylÃ¤. The next three finishers were Norwegian, but DÃ¦hlie would not make the podium. Trailing only Smirnov through 33.4 km, he struggled in the last half of the race and placed fourth, behind his teammate, Sture Sivertsen.

MÃ¼hlegg was a German Ã©migrÃ© who obtained Spanish citizenship in 1999, and who had competed for Germany at the 1992, 1994, and 1998 Winter Olympics. However, in a random blood test shortly before Salt Lake City, MÃ¼hlegg was found to have an elevated hematocrit level, indicating possible drug use. Only a few minutes later, however, a repeat test showed an acceptable hematocrit level, and MÃ¼hlegg was allowed to continue competing. By the time this race started, he had apparently won two gold medals at the 2002 Winter Olympics, in the pursuit and 30 km. In the 50 km race the early leader was Russian Mikhail Ivanov who had been bronze medalist at the 2001 Worlds in the 30 km. He was still leading at the final 40.5 km checkpoint, but on the last lap would be passed by MÃ¼hlegg, who finished very quickly. Rounding out the podium appeared to be Estonia Andrus Veerpalu, who had won the 15 km gold 11 days before, and was well ahead of Norwegian Odd BjÃ¸rn Hjelmeset.
But that podium did not last long. MÃ¼hlegg failed his post-race doping screen, testing positive for darbopoietin, an erythropoietin analogue. He was disqualified from the race, and the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruled in December 2003 that he should be stripped of all three gold medals from the 2002 Winter Olympics. Thus, Ivanov was moved up to the gold medal, Veerpalu to silver, and Hjelmeset won the bronze. A few days later after the 2002 Winter Olympics ended, housecleaners working on the house used by the Austrian cross-country team found blood transfusion equipment. After an investigation, two of the Austrian skiers, Marc Mayer and Achim Walcher, were disqualified from the 2002 Winter Olympics for probable blood doping, This also affected the standings in this race, as Mayer had originally placed 25th.

But he was a strong freestyler and had won the gold medal in the event at the 1992 Winter Olympics, placing fourth in 1994. The last two World Champions had been Mika MyllylÃ¤ of Finland in 1997, and Silvio Fauner of Italy in 1995. MyllylÃ¤ had won the 1996-97 distance World Cup, had already won the 30 km in Hakuba, and might have been a slight favorite, but he was not entered for this race.
The race was extremely close. DÃ¦hlie started slowly and was only 10th at the first checkpoint, moved to fourth at the halfway point, and pulled ahead at around 40 km. The early leader was Austrian Christian Hoffmann but he was worn down by DÃ¦hlie steady approach, and would drop back to the bronze medal position. It was left to Sweden Niklas Jonsson to challenge the Norwegian superstar. Jonsson started slightly ahead of DÃ¦hlie but at 40 km, he was 30 seconds behind. Then he closed very quickly, but was unable to fully close the lead, and DÃ¦hlie won by 8.1 seconds, as they both collapsed across the line.
And thus ended the Olympic career of BjÃ¸rn DÃ¦hlie, the greatest ever cross-country skier. He competed at the 1999 World Championships, with what was, for him, minimal success (a silver and a bronze), and then retired after a roller ski accident in early 2000. In his Olympic career, he won 12 medals and eight gold medals, both absolute Winter Olympic records. His six individual gold medals equals the Winter Olympic mark set by Soviet speed skater Lidiya Skoblikova in 1960-64. At the World Championships DÃ¦hlie won 17 medals and nine gold medals.

DÃ¦hlie started out fast and led at the first checkpoint at 1.6 km. He would lead at every checkpoint and also posted the fastest intermediate splits at the first five checkpoints, only slowing down near the end when he had the race well in hand, as he led by over 1:23 at the 45.3 km time check. Maurilio De Zolt started slowly, only 21st at 1.6 km, but was in second by 10 km, and would hold onto that position throughout, winning the silver medal, as he had in Calgary four years earlier, with a two-minute margin over bronze medalist Giorgio Vanzetta.
DÃ¦hlie, who was better at freestyle than the classical style, would win this event again in Nagano when it reverted to freestyle. Vanzetta had a very long Olympic career. He first competed in 1980 at Lake Placid and would compete again in two years in Lillehammer. He won three medals in Albertville, bronze in this event and the pursuit, and a silver in the relay. De Zolt also started Olympic skiing at Lake Placid, when he was already 30-years-old. When he was 43-years-old, he would lead off the Italian relay team in 1994 that won the gold medal in what is considered the greatest ever Olympic ski race.

With 5 kilometres to go there were still around 18 skiers in the leading group. With a kilometre to go, at least 15 skiers were together.

Until PyeongChang, Niskanen was better known for his achievements in short distance races. At Sochi 2014, he took gold in the team sprint, and at the 2017 World Championships, won the 15 km classical style title. His two firsts in the World Cup also came over 15 km.
Niskanen ran the race from the lead position, increasing the pace from km 19. The leading group of 15 athletes was reduced to just seven at km 21: in addition to Niskanen Kazakhstan Aleksey Poltoranin, the Norwegians Martin Johnsrud Sundby and Niklas Dyrhaug, the Swiss 15 km winner Dario Cologna, Aleksandr Bolshunov, Olympic Athlete from Russia, and Canada Alex Harvey. At the 25 km mark, it was just Niskanen and Poltoranin with Bolshunov in third, 11 seconds behind. When Poltoranin pulled away a few kilometers later, the Finn looked like a sure winner, but the decision when to change his skies now became a tactical and decisive factor. Already with new skies, Bolshunov came back and closed the gap on Niskanen, which had increased to 25 seconds at one stage. By the time Niskanen had changed his skies at 42 km, Bolshunov had increased his lead to 14 seconds. But now it was Niskanen turn to chase and close in on Bolshunov. Niskanen tactics turned out to be the better one: With fresh skies and obviously the greater stamina, he started his final attack with just 1 km to go as Bolshunov could do nothing to counter the Finn attack. Niskanen celebrated the biggest individual success of his career, when he crossed the finish line after 2-08:22.1. The time, which was the slowest in the 50 km since the introduction of the separate techniques, and the mass start, in this event more than 30 years ago, and reflected the demands of the course. A disappointed Bolshunov came second 18.7 seconds behind the winner.
The bronze medal went to another Olympic Athlete from Russia. Even though he was 27-years-of-age, Andrey Larkov was competing in his first Olympics and secured third place 2:37.5 behind Niskanen. Larkov took his time and appeared in the top three for the first time after the 47 km mark. Poltoranin, who ran a lonely race for many kilometers and looked like a sure medalist until km 45, collapsed to eventually finish 15th. Harvey, the reigning world champion, and Sundby, in 2016 the last World Cup winner of a 50 km race in the classical style, finished were in the chasing group throughout the race, but finally saw Larkov pull away for his medal, while they went home without a 50 km Mass Start medal.

Double gold medalist Dario Cologna from Switzerland, who could be seen close to the vanguard throughout the race, was the unlucky fellow on the day, breaking his ski while in fourth place with less than two kilometers to go. The race was effectively decided on the last climb, where the Russians showed their strength. A four-man group of three Russians, Aleksandr Legkov, Maksim Vylegzhanin and Ilya Chernousov, and Norway Martin Johnsrud Sundby entered the stadium clear of the field. With the end almost in sight Legkov overtook Vylegzhanin to move into the pole position and held it to the finish. In a close sprint to the line Vylegzhanin just held on for the silver medal ahead of compatriot Chernousov in a photo finish. Sundby missed out on a medal, finishing just one second behind the winner.
It was the first time in 78 years that athletes from one country achieved a clean sweep in this event; the last time was by Sweden at Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Legkov had turned down the opportunity to carry the Russian flag at the Opening Ceremony because he thought it would be bad for him to leave altitude.
In May 2016 WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) commissioned a report, the McLaren Report, to look into allegations of systematic Russian doping and a cover-up to avoid positives at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. The report was released in two parts, in July and December 2016, and confirmed the allegations. In 2017 the IOC formed a commission to investigate this, headed by IOC Member Denis Oswald, and usually referred to as the Oswald Commission. In late October 2017 the Oswald Commission began to release its findings.
One of the first findings was to implicate Aleksandr Legkov, the gold medalist in this event. Legkov was disqualified and his medal effectively removed. He immediately appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). Eight days later, the silver medalist, Maksim Vylegzhanin, was also disqualified. About 10 days before the PyeongChang Winter Olympics began, the CAS reached a decision and Legkov and Vylegzhanin were exonerated and their medals were restored.
In the case of Legkov, the IOC actually appealed the decision of the CAS to the Swiss Federal Tribunal, which upheld the decision of the CAS, which meant that Legkov was exonerated and his gold medal status restored.

He fell ill with Covid-19 the month before the start of the Games , with his arrival in Beijing delayed due to 10 days in quarantine. KrÃ¼ger did his best to stay in good condition during isolation by using an exercise bike and walking laps of his hotel room.
The field was close together for a long time, and advances by individual runners were repeatedly thwarted. The pace wasnât too high owing to the slow snow on the trail, and the athletes had to pace themselves on the demanding course. The first attacks came after about a third of the race. The field spread out for the first time and a group of about 15 runners was able to pull away. Halfway through the race, it was the Russians who dominated, notably with top favorite Bolshunov.
Eight runners tackled the last few km together and waited for the right moment to make the decisive attack. It was Bolshunov, who injected two decisive bursts of acceleration, at six kilometres then 2.6 kilometres from the finish, to leave his rivals trailing.
Johannes HÃ¸sflot KlÃ¦bo was considered one of the medal candidates on the shortened route. But the Norwegian, who had already won gold twice in Beijing, couldnât keep up the pace halfway through the race and dropped out after 20 kilometres.

The race started at 0530, but Sapporo was in the midst of a heat wave, and it was still very hot for a 50 km event.
The Japanese and Chinese walkers had the best marks coming into 2021 and were expected to be prominent on the podium. Form would most definitely not hold. France Yohann Diniz led at 5K, while China Luo Yadong took over the lead at 10, 15, and 20 km, and Finland Aku Partanen at 25 km, as the Japanese walkers were never a major factor.
Poland Dawid Tomala had only once before raced 50 km, as he was primarily a 20 km specialist, but he survived the heat the best of the field, moving ahead later in the race and winning gold in 3-50:08, negative splitting the race in 1-58:17 / 1-51:51.

Another favorite was Frenchman Yohann Diniz, but he would be disqualified during the race, but not for the usual reasons. Diniz was disqualified for violating Rule 230.9g, âtaking refreshment at other than an official aid station.â
That opened the race up a bit and in the end the gold went to Russian Sergey Kirdyapkin, who was a two-time World Champion (2005, 2009) and won by almost a minute over Australia Jared Tallent, who was also second to Schwazer at Beijing. Kirdyapkin took the lead when he surged after 40 km and had a clear lead at 45 km, which Tallent could never close. Tallent was hampered by two cards for lifting and had to be careful near the end to avoid disqualification. Kirdyapkin victory atoned somewhat for the poor Russian showing in the 20K walk when only one of their walkers, Andrey Krivov, finished and he placed 37th, although 2011 World Champion Sergey Bakulin placed only sixth in this event. The bronze went to Chinese walker Si Tianfeng, which complemented the gold/bronze won by China in the 20K.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected.
All three Russian walkers in this event were disqualified for biological passport offenses. The original gold medalist was Sergey Kirdyapkin, whose disqualification was announced on 20 January 2015. Igor Yerokhin and Sergey Bakulin, who originally finished fifth and sixth, respectively, were also disqualified. The medals in this event were re-assigned to Jared Tallent (AUS / gold), Si Tianfeng (CHN / silver), and Robbie Heffernan (IRL / bronze).
All three Russians were coached by Viktor Chegin, who was infamous for his athletes testing positive for PED usage, which more than 35 of them did between 2005-15. On 17 February 2016, Chegin was banned for life from athletics coaching by the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).

The big Norwegian star Thorleif Haug had won the classical Holmenkollen 50 km (the only cross country event in Holmenkollen until 1933, when the 18 km was included in the program) five times between 1918 and 1923, but in 1922 the Norwegians were shocked by a Finnish double, when Anton Collin and Tapani Niku outclassed the Norwegians and Haug had to be content with a modest 9th place. It was the first time that a non-Norwegian was able to win in Holmenkollen. Besides Collin and Niku, the Norwegians also feared their Swedish neighbours. The small and quiet Torkel Persson, a native Sami from JÃ¤mtland, was considered as the strongest in the team together with Per-Erik Hedlund from SÃ¤rna, the starting point of another Nordic classical competition, Vasaloppet.
The 33 competitors were met with cold and windy conditions when the first starter, the Frenchman AndrÃ© Blusset was sent away at 8:37 AM. The skiers started with intervals of one minute in a one-lap course with a really demanding height difference of 820 meters. First of the favorites was Collin with number 3, chased by the Norwegian Johan GrÃ¸ttumsbraaten 1 minute behind. The big favorite Haug started as number 23, chasing Niku 2 minutes ahead of him.
Already in the early stages of the race, it was clear that this would be a great day for the Norwegians. Collin broke one of his skies and had to give up. GrÃ¸ttumsbraaten had a 1.30 lead over Haug after  20 km, followed by Matti Raivio, Hedlund, Niku and the two other Norwegians, Jon MÃ¥rdalen and Thoralf StrÃ¸mstad. 10 km later all four Norwegians were in front. Haug had overtaken GrÃ¸ttumsbraaten by one minute, with StrÃ¸mstad 7 and MÃ¥rdalen 8 minutes behind. Niku and Hedlund were fading, 15 and 16 minutes behind Haug, and both gave up shortly after. StrÃ¸mstad was fastest in the last stage of the race and passed GrÃ¸ttumsbraaten, but Haug kept his lead to the finish, and his victory margin to StrÃ¸mstad was a clear 1.51. MÃ¥rdalen finished his last 20 km 6 minutes faster than GrÃ¸ttumsbraaten, but had to be content with 4th place. Persson in 5th place was 16 minutes behind MÃ¥rdalen, and all 8 skiers from the Nordic countries that finished the race took the 8th first places. The Italians were the best of the Middle Europeans, placing 9-10-11-13.

Both Sergey Savelyev, gold medalist in 30 km in both the 1976 Winter Olympics and the 1978 World Championships, and Nikolay Zimyatov, newly crowned Olympic gold medalist from the 30 km race nine days earlier, were among the favorites, together with another Soviet skier, Yevgeny Belyayev, silver medalist at the distance in the 1978 World Championships. Their most dangerous rival was expected to be Sven-Ãke LundbÃ¤ck from Sweden, the reigning World Champion. Finland Juha Mieto was not considered a long distance specialist. His first place at the 1973 Holmenkollen in the 50 km was his only major victory at the distance, but he had shown great form and had to be considered. Norway defending Olympic Champion Ivar Formo had quit top-level sport at the age of 26 after the 1978 season to give priority to his engineering studies, leaving Norway hopes to Lars Erik Eriksen, fifth in the 1978 World Championships, and Oddvar BrÃ¥, a gifted skier who had a tendency to disappoint at the big events.
At the first intermediate time at 12.5 km, the fourth and least known skier on the Soviet team, the 24-year old Moscow-born Aleksandr Zavyalov, had taken a clear lead, almost half a minute ahead of Savelyev. With Zimyatov in fourth and Belyayev in fifth place, it looked very promising for the Soviet skiers. At 17 km Zavyalov was still leading, now with Zimyatov second, 33 seconds behind. Jean-Pierre Pierrat, a 27-year old Frenchman who had taken the bronze medal at the distance in the 1978 World Championships, had moved up from 13th to third. Pierrat was a respected marathon skier, winning France first ever Nordic skiing medal, and had also won the prestigious Vasaloppet in 1978. At the halfway point the brave Zavyalov was still in the lead, but now Zimyatov was only three seconds behind. They were already in a class of their own. The skier in third place, Finland Asko Autio, was 1:17 behind. Savelyev was still fourth, Pierrat now dropping down to sixth. At 42 km, Zimyatov had made his move, taking the lead from his struggling teammate Zavyalov and building up a one and a half minute lead. Skiing fastest of all behind Zimyatov, Juha Mieto had advanced from eighth to third, 40 seconds behind Zayvalov and 40 seconds ahead of Savelyev, still in fourth position. Eriksen had moved up to fifth, only 18 seconds behind. Autio had lost two minutes to his closest rival and had dropped to seventh, and Pierrat was also fading.
In the final part of the race Zimyatov extended his lead in a most impressive way, winning his third gold medal at Lake Placid by a margin of almost three minutes. Juha Mieto skied a well-judged race and took another silver medal ahead of Zavyalov, who struggled at the end but was able to edge out Eriksen by 1.5 seconds for the bronze. With Salvelyev and Belyayev in fifth and sixth place it was a triumphant day for the Soviet skiers. BrÃ¥ and LundbÃ¤ck gave away too much in the first half of the race, but finished decently as seventh and eighth. With his Olympic victory over 50 km, Nikolay Zimyatov was definitively the king of cross-country skiing at the 1980 Winter Games, winning three out of a possible four gold medals.

Two of their entrants, among them their favorite Sven UtterstrÃ¶m, were ill and were replaced before the start, so the Swedish contingent had no big expectations.
The morning start was held in mild weather conditions, but the forecast predicted colder weather during the day. However, this turned out to be completely wrong. One hour after the start the temperature changed completely, with the famous fÃ¶hn wind coming from the south with the result that the temperature rose to 25Â° C. (77Â° F.) in the sun. This created big problems for the skiers, and it ended with one of the slowest 50 km. in the history of skiing, the winning time was one hour behind Thorleif Haug winning performance 4 years earlier.
The Norwegian Ole Hegge was in front in the first stage of the race, but at 15 km. Per-Erik Hedlund, a strong lumberjack from SÃ¤rna, equaled Hegge intermediate time, and from then on the Swedes, apparently having done a better job with their skis, totally dominated the race. Hedlund, who was not able to finish the 50 km. in Chamonix four years earlier, opened up a substantial lead, at the 35 km. mark he was almost eight minutes ahead of his fellow countryman Gustaf Jonsson, followed by substitute Volger Andersson another 1:30 behind the leader. Hedlund took his time to stop and prepare his skis, certainly a wise decision, since he was then able to expand his lead substantially. The Norwegians and Finns were really struggling, Hegge was already almost 22 minutes behind the leader, slightly ahead of the best Finn, the eldest of the Lappalainen brothers, Tauno. They were both now behind the slow starting Norwegian Olav Kjelbotn, who had advanced from a modest 11th place to 4th, but without being able to catch up on the Swedish trio. Hedlund won the race with the biggest margin in Olympic skiing history, 13:27 ahead of silver medalist Jonsson, who was slightly ahead of the surprise bronze medalist, the substitute Andersson. The early leader Hegge struggled gallantly in to 5th place, over 25 minutes behind Hedlund, but was able to beat the best of the Finns, Tauno Lappalainen, by half a minute.

He was World Champion in 1958 and 1962 and Olympic Champion in 1956. His only loss in a major championships was when he placed fifth in the 1960 Olympic Games. In the 1962 World Championships he won by a comfortable margin ahead of countryman Assar RÃ¶nnlund and defending Olympic Champion Kalevi HÃ¤mÃ¤lainen. The 50 km was organized three days after the 15 km race and one day before Jernberg 35th birthday.
HÃ¤mÃ¤lainen was in the lead after 10 km, 14 seconds ahead of Harald GrÃ¸nningen and with RÃ¶nnlund and Jernberg close behind. At the halfway point HÃ¤mÃ¤lainen had increased his lead to 49 seconds, with RÃ¶nnlund now in second position and Jernberg close behind in third. At 35 km HÃ¤mÃ¤lainen was apparently struggling, Jernberg now in second place was only 20 seconds behind. The Norwegian Einar Ãstby was now in third place almost half a minute behind Jernberg, closely followed by Arto Tiainen, an experienced Finnish skier (aged 33) competing in his third Olympics. RÃ¶nnlund was down in fifth place but still in contention for the medals, only 18 seconds behind Ãstby. Another Swede, Janne Stefansson, was moving steadily ahead and had advanced to sixth place.
In the final part of the race defending champion HÃ¤mÃ¤lainen âhit the wallâ and lost almost 9 minutes to Jernberg in the last 15 km. He ended in sixteenth place. Jernberg had complete control over his opponents and finished in superb style, winning his third Olympic gold medal, over a minute ahead of team-mate RÃ¶nnlund, who after a good finish secured a Swedish double. A tired Tiainen snatched the bronze medal only six seconds ahead of Stefansson, preventing a clean sweep for the Swedes. The fastest finisher of all was the Norwegian favorite Sverre Stensheim, winner of the Holmenkollen 50 km three times in a row (1959-1961). He advanced from a modest 13th place at the halfway point ending fifth, only 17 seconds from the bronze medal. Double Olympic Champion Eero MÃ¤ntyranta was apparently tired after his two victories earlier in the week and ended up ninth.

The mild weather during and after the 18 km. race melted the snow away in the open areas, and only in the forest was there enough snow to make a cross country track. Therefore it was decided to make a 25 km. track for the 50 km., to be skied in two laps, with the start and finish area moved into the forest, several kilometers away from the nearest dwellings. During the race the temperature was around zero, and the conditions were acceptable in spite of the thin layer of snow.
Early on it turned out to be a Finnish day. At the first lap Veli Saarinen was in the lead, one minute in front of his countryman VÃ¤inÃ¶ Liikkanen, followed by Sweden Sven UtterstrÃ¶m and three Norwegians: Arne Rustadstuen, Sigurd Vestad and Ole Hegge, who was 5th at the distance in St. Moritz four years earlier. Hegge had already lost five minutes to the leader Saarinen. On the second lap UtterstrÃ¶m faded. At the end an exhausted Saarinen was able to cling to the lead ahead of fast finishing Liikkanen and won by a margin of 20 seconds. Hegge had the fastest second lap of all skiers, but was not able to catch Rustadstuen in the battle for the bronze medal. Rustadstuen started three minutes behind Hegge, and was able to better his countryman time by 11 seconds.  Veli Saarinen gold medal was the first ever won by a Finn in an Olympic skiing event.

The snow conditions were difficult, as temperature changes forced most of the skiers to re-wax their skies up to three times during the race. The Swedes hoped to avenge their disappointing results in the short distance event. Their favorites were Gunnar Eriksson, World Champion in 1950 and the defending Olympic champion, Nils Karlsson.
At 13 km. World Champion Eriksson, who started eighth, was a clear leader, almost a minute ahead of two other early starters, Norwegians Harald Maartmann and Olav Ãkern. But Eriksson got into trouble with his skis and ended in 12th place. Ãkern, a veteran at 40-years-old, had spent over two years as a prisoner in Germany during the war. By 30,5 km. things had changed. The Finn Veikko Hakulinen, aged 27 but still a newcomer on the international scene, had taken the lead, 20 seconds faster than the Norwegian Magnar Estenstad. At 42 km. Hakulinen had increased his lead to 2:10, with Estenstad still in second position. The 33-year-old Finn Eero Kolehmainen had moved up to third position, 50 seconds behind Estenstad.
The first skier to finish was the first starter, Kalevi Mononen of Finland, but a few minutes later Ãkern was able to beat his time and take over the lead. Then Hakulinen finished in superb style with the famous final time of 3:33.33, bettering Ãkern time by over five minutes. Estenstad was able to keep ahead of Ãkern, but then the final starter, Kolehmainen, had a strong finish, beating Estenstad by 17 seconds and securing a Finnish double. The Finnish coach, Veli Saarinen had a well organized crew around the track, about 300 âFinnish touristsâ, including about seven with a radio. His team would regularly report snow conditions around the track, allowing for the optimal choice for re-waxing the skis (which might one minute to do, but would gain several minutes in ski time). Also, Saarinen was able to report tactics and split times to the skiers.

The two newly crowned champions from 30 km and 15 km, Franco Nones and Harald GrÃ¸nningen, were not among the participants. At the first official intermediate time at 15 km, Reidar Hjermstad, who came into the Norwegian team as a substitute for GrÃ¸nningen, was in a clear lead, 21 seconds ahead of his countryman Ole EllefsÃ¦ter, who had skied the anchor leg for the victorious Norwegian relay team three days earlier. At the halfway point EllefsÃ¦ter had taken the lead, 44 seconds ahead of Sweden Melcher Risberg, who had advanced from fifth place at 15 km. Hjermstad had dropped down to third, 50 seconds behind his countryman. At 40 km EllefsÃ¦ter was still in the lead, but two other skiers had come strongly from behind. His teammate PÃ¥l Tyldum had moved from 11th place at the halfway point to second, only 29 seconds behind, and Soviet Union Vyacheslav Vedenin had moved from tenth to third, one minute behind the leader. Over the last 10 km EllefsÃ¦ter was able to cling to the lead and won Norway first Olympic gold medal at the distance since Thorleif Haug won in the first Winter Olympics in 1924. Vedenin finished strongly for a silver medal 17 seconds behind, but the fastest finisher was the surprise man of the day, Switzerland Josef Haas. The 30-year old skier from Marbach in Sankt Gallen moved up from 6th to bronze position during the last 10 km, and finished only 29 seconds behind the winner. He skied the last 10 km 48 seconds faster than the Olympic Champion EllefsÃ¦ter. Haas was the first skier from Middle Europe winning a medal in the Olympic 50 km race. Tyldum was unable to defend his second place and finished fourth, another 12 seconds behind Haas and closely followed by the two Swedes Risberg and Gunnar Larsson, the bronze medalist from the 15 km race. Only 0.2 seconds separated the two Swedes. EllefsÃ¦ter winning time of 2-28:45.8 stood unbeaten in international skiing championships until 1980, when Olympic Champion Nikolay Zimyatov bettered EllefsÃ¦ter winning time by 1:21, six years after the equipment revolution of fiberglass skis in 1974.

He was full of self confidence before the last event, the 50 km race, organized the day before the closing of the Games. With defending Olympic champion PÃ¥l Tyldum also on the team Norway hoped for revenge, but they feared the Soviet skiers, and also the reigning World Champion, East German Gerhard Grimmer, who was counted as a major contender for the gold.
At 10 km, the 24-year old Soviet Vasily Rochev, bronze medalist in 15 km at the 1974 World Championship, had taken the lead, 13 seconds ahead of Sven-Ãke  LundbÃ¤ck from Sweden, 1972 Olympic Champion in the 15 km.

Over the last 10 km, Rochev and Koch faded badly, losing five minutes more to the leaders and dropped down to 12th and 13th place in the final results. Formo ran a perfect calculated race, finished fastest of all and restored Norwegian cross-country pride with a gold medal, Norway being the first nation to win the 50 km at three consecutive Winter Olympics. Klause was a clear second, and SÃ¶dergren well paced finish earned Sweden their only Nordic skiing medal at the 1976 winter Olympics.

Norway hopes relied on the winner of the 50 km at Holmenkollen in 1959, 26-year old Sverre Stensheim, but Stensheim, with his disappointing 20th place in the 30 km race, was apparently feeling uncomfortable in the Californian highlands, as parts of the track were over 2000 m above sea level.
Jernberg was in front at the 10 km mark, 23 seconds ahead of HÃ¤mÃ¤lÃ¤inen, with Hakulinen and RÃ¤mgÃ¥rd in third place, another 10 seconds behind. Nikolay Anikin followed closely in fifth place.

Hakulinen had advanced to second place 22 seconds back, and RÃ¤mgÃ¥rd was still in third position, closely behind Hakulinen. At 35 km HÃ¤mÃ¤lÃ¤inen had widened the gap down to Hakulinen to 34 seconds, and RÃ¤mgÃ¥rd could not keep up with pace of the Finnish duo.

Everybody then expected the 50 km. to be a duel between the defending Olympic champion Veikko Hakulinen and the consistent Swede, Sixten Jernberg, which proved to be correct. Jernberg, with two Olympic silver medals already in his pocket, took the command from the start. Starting five minutes behind his arch rival, he had a clear, but not decisive lead at the halfway point, 35 seconds faster than his Finnish rival. Anatoly Shelyukhin from Soviet was in third place, closely followed by his countryman Fyodor Terentyev, a 30-year old Karelian who came sixth at the 30 km. event six days earlier.
Jernberg steadily increased the gap over Hakulinen and crossed the finish line 1:18 ahead of the defending champion. Terentyev also had a strong finish, passing the fading Shelyukhin by 35 km. and finished as a clear bronze medal winner. Eero Kolehmainen, the silver medalist from 1952, also passed Shelyukhin in the final stage of the race, but had to be content with fourth place.

The race turned out to be one of the most thrilling duels in the history of 50 km cross-country skiing, with the two Swedes playing the main roles. It was a duel between experience represented by Wassberg and youth represented by Svan. After 7 km Wassberg had a five second lead, while at 19.7 km he had increased his lead to 15 seconds.

The winner of that event, Hungarian ZoltÃ¡n von Halmay was not in Seoul to defend his title.
The two favorites were the American Tom Jager and Matt Biondi, who had traded the world record between them since Jager first swam 22.40 in 1985. Biondi broke the mark in 1986 with 22.33, equaling that in 1987, but then Jager swam 22.32 to win the 1987 Pan Pacs, and improved to 22.23 at the 1988 US Nationals. Jager was a slight favorite, having won not only those two races, but also the 1986 Worlds. One swimmer not challenging was South African Peter Williams, who could not be in Seoul because the IOC did not recognize South Africa, and also could not technically hold the world record, although he had the world best ever time of 22.18.
The final saw Biondi lead off the blocks, which was an upset in itself, as Jager had always been the faster starter. Biondi always finished faster, and with that start, he could not be caught, winning in a world record 22.14, with Jager finishing second in 22.36. Bronze went to Soviet Gennady Prigoda, runner-up at the 1987 Europeans, edging out Switzerland Dano Halsall, runner-up at the 1986 Worlds. This was Biondi sixth medal, and fourth gold, of the Seoul Olympics.

The favorites were China Yang Wenyi, who had set the world record of 24.98 earlier in 1988, and Romania Tamara Costache, the 1986 World Champion and 1987 European Champion, and a three-time world record setter. To date the pool at the Seoul Olympics had been the personal property of East German Kristin Otto, who had already won five gold medals. She had been second in the 50 free at 86 Worlds, but was considered a longshot in this event.
There were two false starts in the final and some thought that this bothered Yang. She still held the lead with Otto for much of the race, but Otto just touched her out in 25.49, winning her very surprising sixth gold medal in Seoul. Costache was a non-factor, placing sixth. The bronze medals were shared by 15-year-old East German Katrin MeiÃner and the relatively ancient 27-year-old American Jill Sterkel, who both finished in 25.71. Sterkel had last won an Olympic medal 12 years ago, in MontrÃ©al, a gold in the freestyle relay. She had only made the US team when Angel Myers was disqualified after the US Olympic Trials for a positive drug test. The fifth-place finisher was another American, Leigh Ann Fetter, a freshman at the University of Texas, where her assistant coach was Sterkel.
In 1994 it was revealed that Otto had been a part of the long-time East German doping conspiracy as she had been given drugs by her coaches throughout her career. Otto denied any knowledge of this however, and stated that her performances were due not to the drugs, but to her hard work.

The St. Louis Globe Democrat reported the results of that final as follows, âScarcely had the men finished than Leary threw up his arms in the air and yelled to the officials on the float and in the stands âFoul.â As soon as he could swim to the float, he did so and claimed that Halmay interfered with him near the finish and tried to pull him back. While it was acknowledged that Halmay course was the strongest in the world, all thoughts of his attempting to deliberately foul Leary were cast to the winds and the foul was disallowed. Up in the stands, however, the judges werenât able to decide who won the event. One of the judges, a Hungarian, began to call Halmay the winner before he was within three yards of the finish and finally selected his countryman as the winner.

Japan Joji Kato lowered the mark to 34.30, taking over the record from compatriot Hiroyasu Shimizu. While also the 2005 World Champion, Kato had far from dominated the 2005/2006 season, with World Cup wins going to Jeremy Wotherspoon (2003 and 2004 World Champion), Lee Gang-Seok, Yu Fengtong, Dmitry Dorofeyev and Joey Cheek. The latter two skaters had also surprisingly finished 1-2 at the most recent World Sprint Championships, winning one 500 m race each.
After the first run, the winner already seemed certain. American Joey Cheek was the only skater to beat 35 seconds (34.82), and led with a huge margin of 4 tenths over Dmitry Dorofeyev. The fight for bronze was close, with Lee (35.34), Yuya Oikawa (35.35), Wotherspoon (35.37) and Yu (35.39) within 0.05 seconds of each other. World record holder Kato was back in 11th and out of medal contention.
The second run showed pretty much the same picture. Cheek was again the only one under 35 seconds (now with 34.94), and Dorofeyev consolidated his second place, despite being a bit slower than Lee. Cheek proved a popular Olympic champion, especially after he announced to give away his $25,000 award from the US Olympic Committee to charity (âRight to Playâ, founded by Johann Olav Koss). Medals won by Dorofeyev and and Lee were the first speed skating medals for their countries since 1994 and 1992, respectively. Dorofeyev 2006 successes were a remarkable departure from his earlier results, having only a 1999 World Cup victory as a notable prior achievement.

The 2018 bronze medalist had clocked three sub-34-second races in the season, and set an unofficial world record at the TomaszÃ³w-Mazowiecki World Cup, opening in 9.32 seconds. Gao, however, had plenty of contenders to fight off. Reigning World Champion Laurent Dubreuil was also leading the World Cup standings, and two of Japan entries â Wataru Morishige and Tatsuya Shinhama â had also won races earlier in the season. Missing from the field was world record holder Pavel Kulizhnikov. The three-time World Champion had had a poor season and did not qualify for the strong ROC team in this event.
As he had not raced in all World Cup races, Gao was the first of the favorites to start, and he immediately set a tough target for the others. Following a 9.42 opening, he bested the Olympic Record with 34.32. In the tenth pair, 2018 silver medalist Cha Min-Gyu recorded the best full lap of the field (24.75), which landed him at 34.39, second behind. After him, many the outsiders for a medal fell short â Michalski (35.52), Arefyev (34.56), Murakami (34.57). Only in the penultimate pair did Morishige come close to the leading times, 34.49, guaranteeing Gao a medal. The final race between Dubreuil and Shinhama then saw the Canadian controversially false start. Replays showed no signs of a false start, while earlier Gao had not been completely still. Possibly affected, Shinhama then stumbled in the first metres, throwing away his shot at a medal. Dubreuil did continue at full pace, but with 34.52 just fell out of the podium.

At the World Championships in Davos, which had been held little more than a week before this Olympic contest, he had bettered Oscar Mathisen 14-year-old World Record of 43,4 by three tenths of a second. This record had not brought him the world title, which was taken by Clas Thunberg, a triple Olympic champion in Chamonix. Finn Thunberg, bronze medallist four years earlier, was also a contender in the shortest event, as were the other Norwegians: Haakon Pedersen, Oskar Olsen and Bernt Evensen.
The North Americans were somewhat of an enigma to the Europeans. They had skated in Norway, but only against second-rate Norwegians or on imperial distances. The first pair of the 500 m, with John OâNeil Farrell (USA) and Oskar Olsen (NOR), immediately showed what they were capable of. Farrell clocked 43.6, a new Olympic Record. The next race saw the two biggest title contenders pitted against each other. Roald Larsen took the early lead over Clas Thunberg, but the World Champion gained on the World Record holder in the back straight, making for an exciting sprint on the final 100 m. Thunberg won in an excellent time of 43.4, while Larsen equalled Farrell time. Haakon Pedersen went below 44 in the following race, but was already out of medal contention. The next big fight was between the two remaining Norwegians, Evensen and Olsen. The latter skated poorly, but 1927 World Champion Evensen went all out and stopped the watches at 43.4 - identical to Thunberg mark.
Finland Jaakko Friman, an outsider who had won the Finnish selection race for the Olympics, then also skated 43.6, making for two first place skaters, and three in third position. The last potential medallist was Charlie Gorman of Canada. He skated against Kos (NED), who fell in the first curve. Gorman, who finished 7th in the 43.9 claimed he was obstructed by his opponent fall. His protest was disallowed by the jury, which angered Gorman so much he withdrew from the 5000 m held later that same day. The Dutchman did re-skate, albeit out of competition. Kos 47.5 would have ranked him an ex aequo 21st. He was also unlucky in his other Olympic races, falling in both the 1500 m and 5000 m.
After the final pair, some of those in attendance expected tie-breaks for the title and third place, which was fairly common in those days. However, the rules did not allow for such a race and the result stood. It was the first time a gold medal was shared at the Winter Olympics. Evensen co-championship was the first speed skating gold for Norway.

1928 and the disputed pack style rules in 1932), the 500 m in Garmisch also saw controversy. The event was surprisingly won by Norway Ivar Ballangrud. Ballangrud, was hardly a rookie: he was already a triple Olympic medallist by that time, and was the World Champion of 1926, 1932, European Champion of 1929, 1930 and 1933. He had dominated the 1936 season, winning the European and World title in the month prior to the Games. However, Ballangrud was not considered a top sprinter, and even his selection for the Norwegian team on the distance was somewhat contentious. However, the controversy lay in the fact that he beat Georg Krog, Norway top sprinter. While the result of the official timekeepers all agree on the times of both skaters, various (Norwegian) journalists have different accounts. It was quite common in these days for the media to keep their own stopwatches, and check on the times. Some claim Krog time, officially 43.5, should have been four tenths faster - owing the difference to an ambiguous call by the timekeepers to the referee. Others claim Ballangrud time was simply one second too fast, and should have been 44.4 seconds. Norwegian radio reporter Finn Amundsen even re-timed Ballangrud race from the start and finish signals on his own audiotape, and clocked 44.4, like he had during the actual race. In spite of all this, no official protest appears to have been lodged, and the result stands as listed below.
Behind the two Norwegians, several favorites competed for third. Norway two other contenders, Harry Haraldsen and Hans Engnestangen both fell. All four United States skaters were medal potentials, despite the absence of defending Olympic Champion Jack Shea. He was not too fond of travelling to Nazi Germany, and could not afford to stay away from his family that long. Allan Potts had lowered the World Record to 42.4 the month before the Games, but he could do no better than 6th at the Olympics. Del Lamb, winner of the sprint at the World Championships placed 5th, which left Leo Freisinger, who won the bronze medal.

Skating in the second pair, Grishin posted 40.6, which looked solid, and held up for a long time. The time was equaled in the fourth pair by his teammate, Vladimir Orlov, and Norway Alv Gjestvang, skating in the seventh pair, but nobody beat it for a long time. The in the 17th pair, unheralded American Terry McDermott, using skates borrowed from his coach, 1936 500 bronze medalist Leo Freisinger, shocked everyone with a Olympic record time of 40.1. McDermott was skating in his first international event and had skated almost exclusively pack-style prior to the 1964 Winter Olympics. But his time held up for an unlikely gold medal, and it would be the only gold medal won by the United States at the Innsbruck Olympics. In 1968, McDermott would return to win a silver medal, despite skating late in the day, on very slow ice due to a thaw. Grishin, Orlov, and Gjestvang all won silver medals.

Both skaters had already played a feature role in the 1988 edition. Mey had won the title in Calgary, while Jansen had fallen, distracted by his sister death earlier on the day of the race. In the 1992 season, the two had fought out fascinating duels. In the six 500 m World Cup races held before the Olympics, they had finished first and second on all occasions, once even tying for first. Of the remaining races, Mey had won three and Jansen two. In addition, both had bettered the world record during the season. First, Mey had finally bettered his 1988 Olympic time at Davos, only to see it taken away by Jansen a week later, who lowered the mark to 36.41. Behind these two contenders, the Japanese had been most consistently in front, notably Toshiyuki Kuroiwa and Yasunori Miyabe.
Weather conditions were not good, with rain and flaky winds disturbing the competition. The soft ice was also not in favor of heavier skaters, like Jansen or World Sprint Champion Igor Zhelezovsky. Jansen was the first of the favorites to go. With a flaky final curve, he clocked 37.46, just 0.01 below the rink record. It was soon clear this was not good enough for the gold, as Junich Inoue, a completely unknown Japanese skater, beat the time by 2 tenths in the very next pair. Miyabe and Mey then faced eather in pair four. Mey got off to a 9.78 start, well ahead of Miyabe and Inoue split. This opener proved decisive, and Mey finished first in 37.14.

As the first major international competition of the year, it was difficult to pick a favorite. The Finns had been training in Davos prior to coming to Chamonix, and Clas Thunberg had posted 43.8 there, four tenths slower than Oscar Mathisen World Record. The American Olympic Team contested metric events at Saranac Lake prior to leaving for Europe, the fastest sprinter being Charley Jewtraw with 46.6. But as an indication of his speed, Jewtraw had also set a new World Record in the 100 yard (9.4) on January 6th. Fastest Norwegian had been Roald Larsen with 44.6 at Frogner, and with Oskar Olsen they had one of the fastest Europeans on their team.
The very first pair in Olympic speed skating history saw Joe Moore of the U.S. paired with Eric Blomgren of Sweden, the former clocking 45.6 as the first Olympic Record. Moore time went unchallenged until the 11th pair, when Asser Wallenius (44.4 in Davos) stopped the clock at 45 seconds, only to see it improved with 8 tenths by Oskar Olsen in the next race. Defending World Champion Thunberg was unable to beat this time with 44.8. Two North Americans contested pair 15, Charles Jewtraw and Charlie Gorman. The Canadian took the lead, but was soon overtaken by Jewtraw, who held on to the end: 44.0. The only remaining favorite, Larsen, had to skate against a much slower opponent, and also timed 44.8, tying for third place with Clas Thunberg.
Jewtraw had been a top skater in the short distances in the early 1920s. Coming from a poor family, speed skating was expensive, but Jewtraw was âsponsoredâ by Lake Placid businessman Jack Mabbit. He grew to become one of the fastest skaters in the very short distances, which were primarily contested in North America. He had already retired by the 1924 Olympics, but made a comeback to get a ticket to France. After the gold medal, he skated two more Olympic races before retiring once more.

The world record was 41.8, but had been set in 1938 by Norway Hans Engnestangen, who was not competing in St. Moritz. Sweden Halle Janemar was also highly considered as he had won the 500 distance events at the 1946 Worlds and the 1947 Europeans. Of the Americans, Bobby Fitzgerald had won the US Olympic Trials, ahead of Del Lamb and Terry Browne (not on the team). The Norwegian qualification race took place in St. Moritz, a few days before the start of the Olympics. Sverre Farstad bested Thomas Byberg, winner of the 500 m at the Norwegian Championships and Torodd Hauer. The only skater from another country who might have stood a chance was Konstantin Kudryavtsev (USSR), who had set the season best time at that point. But with his country not competing in St. Moritz, leaving room for all four Americans and all four Norwegians to finish in the top eight.
Ice conditions were excellent throughout the race, allowing many skaters to set new personal bests. Already in the second pair, the Olympic Record, still dating from 1928, was broken. Cheered on by many of his countrymen, Bobby Fitzgerald sprinted to 43,2, a time that seemed fit for a medal. It was first approached by his team mate, Ken Henry, who crossed at 43,3. In the twelfth race, Finn Helgesen was up. Having narrowly qualified as the fourth Norwegian, he skated the race of his life. Shattering his pre-Olympic best of 43,7, he went one tenth faster than the leader. The Norwegian looked good for the gold medal, but some contenders remained in the second half of the field.
One of these was Ken Bartholomew (USA), who was drawn against Craig MacKay of Canada. The two false-started several times (sources disagree on the exact number, it may have been as much as thirteen), after which the pair was oddly withdrawn, only to try again after the 20th pair. When the race finally got underway, Bartholomew saw his Canadian opponent fall coming out of the final curve. Despite all this, the American still managed 43,2, tying with Fitzgerald. A third skater would join them two pairs later, as Thomas Byberg (Norway) finished his race in the same time. For the first time ever, three speed skaters shared a medal at the Olympics. The event turned into a virtual team meet between the United States and Norway, with each nation putting its four skaters among the top nine finishers, with Canada Frank Stack placing equal sixth.
The three silver medallists posed a problem to the organization, which only had two silver medals on hand. Therefore, it decided to hand out a bronze medal to one of the Americans, later to be replaced by one of the proper color. The American delegation picked Fitzgerald to receive the silver, and Bartholomew to receive the temporary bronze. This infuriated the temperamental Bartholomew, who refused to go to the medal ceremony. Instead, fifth-placed Ken Henry showed up, seemingly to receive this bronze medal on behalf of his team mate. But Henry kept the medal to himself, although he did win his own Olympic medal when he won the 1952 event in Oslo. It is not known if Bartholomew ever received his silver medal, but he was sent home by the US team leader immediately after the incident. Despite his status as one of the best American sprinters in the coming years, he was never again selected for international competition.

He raced shoulder to shoulder on the final straight with North American champion Frank Stack of Canada, easing up before the finish as their gap to the rest was sufficient. Defending Olympic Champion Evensen was drawn in the second heat, which he won ahead of Willy Logan, who surprisingly eliminated Ray Murray, one of the favourites.

Going into the final curve, Shea had a 3 yard gap on the Norwegian, which he managed to extend further in the final 100 meters, breaking the finish tape with 5 metres on Evensen, who was followed by Hurd, Logan, Stack and Farrell. His time of 43.4 was the fastest time of the season up to that moment, and equalled the Olympic Record.
After the race, the three medalists became the first Olympians to be awarded their prizes on a podium, as it is still done today. The ceremony was far less organised than it is now, the podium being crowded by bystanders and nearly invisible for most spectators. An embarrassing incident occurred when IOC president Henri de Baillet-Latour handed out the wrong medals to Evensen and Hurd. The two skaters were standing on the wrong side of champion Shea, but this was not noticed by the highest Olympic official.

Grishin was the defending champion and the world record holder, twice setting the record in 1956 at Misurina. He was actually a solid all-around skater, having won the 1956 European Championship and placing third at the Worlds in 1954 and 1956, but had not skated at the Worlds in 1958-59. The early leader in the race was Norway Alv Gjestvang, posting 40.8 in the second pair. His time was beaten in the fifth pair by American Bill Disney, who finished in 40.3. That time held up until the 15th pair, in which Grishin skated. He was looking to win easily, and it appeared he would break the 40-second barrier, but he stumbled badly on the homestretch, costing him perhaps a full second. But his dominance was such that he still won, finishing in 40.2 for his second consecutive gold medal in the event. In the next pair, his teammate, Rafael Grach, posted 40.4 to win the bronze medal. Grishin had shared the 1,500 gold in 1956 and a few days later, would also defend his gold medal in that event, remarkably again sharing the gold in a tie for first place. Grishin would compete thru 1964, retiring after winning a silver medal in the 500 at Innsbruck. In 1963 at Medeo, he broke the world record twice, posting 39.6 on 27 January to break the 40-second barrier, a time he bettered with 39.5 the next day.

South Korean Bae Gi-Tae had won four World Cup races, while East German Uwe-Jens Mey had taken three. American Dan Jansen had won two, but was nevertheless the top favorite. A week before the Games, he had won the World Sprint Championships at West Allis by winning three of the four distances, including both 500 ms. Also in contention were Jan Ykema, a Dutchman who had won a World Cup race in Innsbruck, and Nick Thometz, who held the world record in the event since March 1987, with 37.55.
After Ykema had lowered the Olympic Record in the first pair, Dan Jansen was due to skate in the second heat. Just hours before the race, he had learned of the death of his sister, Jane, who had long suffered of leukemia. His family insisted that he start his race, but a distracted Jansen fell in the first curve and did not finish the race. The drama for Jansen would repeat itself a few days later, when he also fell in the 1,000 m.
Next up was Sergey Fokichev, the defending champion. Despite recording the fastest opener, his 36.82 would land him just outside the medals. These were taken by the skaters in pair four, Mey and Akira Kuroiwa. Mey had been runner-up behind Jansen at West Allis, while Kuroiwa was the 1983 and 1987 World Champion. Mey clearly beat his Japanese opponent and with 36.45, he lowered the world record by a tenth of a second. Kuroiwa was three tenths behind, and narrowly missed Ykema time with 36.77. While East Germany had taken many Olympic speed skating titles already, Mey was the first man from that country to do so.

The world record holder was Pavel Pegov, who set the mark of 36.57 at Medeo in 1983, but he was competing only in the 1,000 in Sarajevo. The 1983 World Sprints had been won by Japan Akira Kuroiwa, but he was also only in the 1,000. In the opening pair American Nick Thometz posted 38.56, but he was bested by his pairmate, Fokichev, who finished in 38.19. In that pair, Japan Yoshihiro Kitazawa, a complete unknown, finished in 38.30 to move into second place ahead of Thometz. The sixth pair had American Dan Jansen and the 1981 World Sprints champion, Frode RÃ¸nning of Norway, and they were considered threats, although Jansen was still young. Jansen narrowly finished ahead of his teammate, Thometz, posting 38.55, but RÃ¸nning was disappointing with 38.58. The next pair had Canada GaÃ©tan Boucher, who had been second at the 1982 World Sprints. When he finished in 38.39 the medals were decided. There were 14 pairs yet to race, but as the sun warmed the ice, only the early starters could contend. Fokichev was the gold medalist, but had been a complete unknown outside the Soviet Union until recently, having never competed internationally prior to the 1983-84 season. He would turn out to be a fairly good sprinter, winning both 500s at the 1984 and 1987 World Sprints, and posting two World Cup victories over 500 metres.
One unusual competitor in the event was Errol Fraser of the British Virgin Islands. Born in New York, Fraser had dual citizenship and had competed in a few international races training for the Winter Olympics. He was the first Olympian from the British Virgin Islands or any Caribbean nation, and was the first black Olympic speed skater.

But of these three, only Ishihara made the final, where he was soundly beaten by Englishman Wilf OâReilly, who also recorded the fastest time of the tournament.

Sheffield Speed Skating Oval, Lake Placid",37 from 18 countries,na,na,"The 500 metres was the opening event of the 1980 speed skating competition. The champion was expected to come from the first pair, with Eric Heiden facing the world record holder and defending champion Yevgeny Kulikov (URS). In fact, Kulikov had set four of the last five world records, but all were set in 1975, and all at the Kazakh speed factory of Medeo. Heiden had won the 1977-80 World Sprint championships, but was considered vulnerable because of the short nature of the event, and his best time of 37.80, set at Inzell in 1979, was far from Kulikov 37.00 world record. In 1979 Heiden won all four races at the World Sprints, but in 1977-78, he had lost three of the four 500s at the World Sprints. And at the recent 1980 World Sprints, he had lost one 500 to US teammate Tom Plant, but Plant skated only the 1,500 in Lake Placid. Further, Heiden started on the outer, meaning he had to finish on the more difficult inner lane, but it mattered little. Kulikov started slightly faster â 10.08 to 10.13, but Heiden crushed him, 38.03 to 38.37. The time was far off Kulikov world record but the ice was not considered fast. Kulikov had a slight stumble on the final curve and later claimed it cost him the gold. In the second pair, Norway Frode RÃ¸nning posted 38.66, showing how quick Heiden time had been. In the fifth pair, Dutch sprinter Lieuwe de Boer, who had recently won both 500s at the Dutch Sprint Championships, came across in 38.48, which would win him the bronze medal. This was somewhat of an upset, as he had never medaled internationally. Nobody could better the times Heiden and Kulikov had set in the first pair and Heiden had his first gold medal.

He was expected to cross blades again with Kim Dong-Seong, who was looking for revenge after his disqualification in the 1,500 m. And while World Record holder Jeffrey Scholten was not selected, the Canadians were assumed to have a shot at a medal, especially Marc Gagnon.
Of these favorites, only Gagnon made it to the final. Ohno was disqualified for an illegal overtaking move in his semi-final, while Kim was narrowly outskated in his. Gagnon did make the final, for the third time in a row. Both in 1994 and 1998, he had fallen and finished outside of the medals. But in Salt Lake, things finally went his way. In a very fast race, the four-time World Champion won the gold ahead of his team mate Jonathan Guilmette and Rusty Smith (USA). It was Gagnon second Olympic gold medal after his 1998 relay gold, and he would add another one later on the evening, when the Canadians successfully defended their title.

He was challenged by his teammate Valery Muratov, who interrupted his record run, setting one world record himself at Medeo in 1975. Strangely neither had won the 1975 World Sprints, that going to their teammate Aleksandr Safranov, with Kulikov second and Muratov third, but Safranov was better in the 1,000 and would not compete in the 500 in Innsbruck. The first fast time in the event was set by American  Peter Mueller in the second pair, posting 39.57. Kulikov was off in the next pair and his fast start, 100 in 9.86, which was the best time of the race, brought him home in 39.17 to take the lead. Nobody approached that time in the next six pairs, with Muratov going off in the 10th with the United Statesâ Dan Immerfall. Immerfall was a challenger, having won the 500 at the 1976 World Juniors in January, and winning one of the 500s at the 1973 World Sprints. Muratov started in 9.96, while Immerfall had a slow start with 10.13. And that set the stage for their finish as Muratov came home in 39.25, followed by Immerfall in 39.54. Though they did not catch Kulikov, who won the gold medal, this brought them the silver and bronze medals. This was the highlight of Kulikov competitive career, and his performances fell off after 1976, although in 1981 he would set another world record of 36.91 at Medeo, the first skater to better 37 seconds. In March 1976, Immerfall would place second at the 1976 World Sprints, winning both 500s.

The Soviet skater improved it to 41,2 two weeks later at the National Championships, with Yevgeny Grishin also going below Engnestangen old mark. But with the Soviet Union absent from Oslo, the title fight would again be between Norway and the United States. A week before the Olympics, an international competition at Hamar saw Norway Sigmund SÃ¸fteland winning the 500 m, narrowly ahead of defending champion Finn Helgesen and Ken Henry, winner of the US Olympic Trials.
The first Norwegian-American fight took place in the third race between Arne Johansen and Don McDermott. In a close race, the American won by virtue of his fast final metres, beating his opponent 43,9 to 44,0. These times went unbeaten for several pairs, although Hroar Elvenes came close with 44,1. Heat 12 was another close affair, with Gordon Audley (Canada) facing the 1948 Olympic Champion, Helgesen. Both skaters were timed with 44,0, but Audley had a small advantage over the Norwegian, putting him in a tie for second, and Helgesen out of medal contention.
Ken Henry, barely recovered from the flu, clearly distinguished himself from the rest of the field in pair 14. His final time of 43,2 was well ahead of the others, and just a tenth outside Helgesen Olympic Record. This time stood until the end of the competition, as favourites SÃ¸fteland and Fitzgerald (medalist in 1948) disappointed.
As one of Norway top sprinters, Finn Hodt had been selected for the Norwegian 500 m squad. But his selection caused a big commotion in Norway because of Hodt past. A member of the Norway fascist Nasjonal Samling, he had broken the sports embargo by skating during the German occupation. He had also served on the Eastern front for two years. He was imprisoned for several years as a collaborator, and returned to skating in 1951. But a public outcry after his selection prevented him from competing in the Oslo Games, as the Norwegian Olympic Committee blocked his participation. Hodt would make the team in 1956, and would later become a very successful skating coach.

Lee Gang-Seok, Lee Gyu-Hyeok (both South Korea), Tucker Fredricks (United States), Keiichiro Nagashima, Joji Kato (both Japan) and Mika Poutala (Finland) had all won a World Cup race during the season, with Nagashima and Lee Gang-Seok also winning a 500 m at the World Sprint Championships. Then there was also the home-town favorite, Jeremy Wotherspoon. Long a dominant force in the 500 m, Wotherspoon had missed the 2008-09 season after breaking his arm in a fall. Lacking only an Olympic gold medal in his prize cabinet, Wotherspoon was hoping to fill that void in Vancouver.
The race had trouble getting underway. Halfway through the first run, the two ice resurfacing machines broke down. The spare machine then damaged the ice. Many coaches and team leaders then pressed for a postponement, but the referees eventually decided to continue the race under pressure from the ISU president, Ottavio Cinquanta. With one machine repaired, the event was continued after an hour and a half delay. It was Mika Poutala, known for his pre-start antics, who had clocked the best time, 34.863. He was closely trailed by the surprising Mo Tae-Beom of South Korea and Kato. But several others were not far off the medal pace, the with the entire top ten less than three tenths off the leader pace.
But the positions would shift quite a bit in second race. Keiichiro Nagashima of Japan moved up from sixth to silver medal position with 34.876, the best time of the second run. He was then topped in overall time by Mo, who was marginally faster than his own first run. The last race was then between Kato and Poutala. The leading Finn seemingly succumbed to the pressure, and only recorded the 11th best time and dropped out of the medals. Kato, a former world record holder, only had to beat Mo time by 0.014, but instead failed to break the 35-second barrier. Although Kato held on to third place, this gave the gold to Mo Tae-Beom, who had never before had won an international competition, and was considered more of a middle distance expert. In addition, it was the first ever gold medal for South Korea in Olympic speed skating.

Though Soviet skaters had not competed internationally prior to 1953, Grishin had competed at the Worlds and Europeans in 1954 and 1955, and won all the 500 m distances except for the 1955 Worlds. Only six days before this event was held, Grishin skated in a pre-Olympic meet on the Misurina rink and shattered the world record with 40.2, bettering the previous record by 6/10ths of a second. That mark of 40.8 had been set by Yury Sergeyev, who had recorded it in January 1955 at Medeo, and Sergeyev was in Cortina to compete. The event started at noon and Grishin was in the first pair. When he finished in 40.2, equaling his world record, the gold medal was decided as nobody would get close to him. Sergeyev was in the second pair and finished in 41.1, which would eventually land him in fourth place. The other medals would eventually be won by Soviet skater Rafael Grach in second place, but 6/10ths behind Grishin, and Norwegian Alv Gjestvang, who won bronze. Gjestvang won his medal despite a near fall during the race. Both were quite unknown prior to 1956 outside their own nations, never having competed internationally before. But both would prove to be good sprinters, Grach returning to win a bronze in the 500 at the 1960 Olympics and Gjestvang winning a silver in the event in 1964. Gjestvang would also finish third in the event at the 1956 and 1959 World Championships.
Yevgeny Grishin would win another gold in Cortina two days later in the 1,500 metres. At Squaw Valley in 1960 he would return and repeat his gold medal victories in both events, though strangely, both 1,500 m gold medals were shared. During his career he set seven world records, all at distances 1,500 metres or shorter. His world records of 40.2 set in Misurina would last until 27 January 1963, when he broke them at Medeo, and in the process became the first skater to race 500 metres in under 40 seconds, finishing in 39.6. The next day, he bettered that with 39.5, his final world record.

Looking at the World Cup season, wins had been recorded by the Dutch twins Ronald Mulder and Michel Mulder, the defending Olympic and world champion Mo Tae-Beom, Japanese skaters Keiichiro Nagashima and Joji Kato, while there had been surprise victories from Artyom Kuznetsov, Tucker Fredricks and Gilmore Junio.
While earlier skaters raced around the 35-second mark in the first heat, Jan Smeekens was the first to set a serious mark. His 34.59 in the 15th pair would prove the fastest time in the first race. It was most closely approached by Michel Mulder, the 2013 and 2014 World Sprint Champion, who lost just 0.04. Nagashima (34.79) and Mo (34.84) were further back, but still in contention, as were Kato and Ronald Mulder (both with 34.96).
In the 17th pair of the second heat, Ronald Mulder turned up the heat by finishing in 34.49, threatening his two leading compatriots with a time just 0.07 above the 2002 Olympic Record. Twin brother Michel couldnât match that time, but with a displayed time of 34.71, he was fast enough to be ranked first, while Mo and Kato fell behind the Dutch brothers. Smeekens needed a finishing time of 34.72 to earn the gold - and despite a wide last turn, that is exactly what he skated. Assuming he had won, he began celebrating, but right at that time a correction of Mulder time came in. Probably due to a failing leg responder, his time was corrected by an unusual 0.04 margin, moving Mulder from 2nd to 1st within half a lap of Smeekens finishing. In the ensuing confusion, the referees reviewed their races in thousands of seconds, even though this is normally only done in case of ties. In the final ranking, therefore, Mulder was put at 69.312 and Smeekens at 69.324 - the smallest difference ever in the two-race event at the Olympics. The Dutch, who had never won a 500 m gold medal, now swept the event, their second medal sweep in just three days.

But Leo Linkovesi of Finland had recently broken Keller world record with 38.0 in Davos in January 1972. And Ard Schenk was a mild threat. Schenk was the greatest all-around skater in the world, and was trying to win four gold medals in the four speed skating events, to duplicate the feat of Lidiya Skoblikova in 1964, but he was a longshot in the 500.
In the first pair Sweden Hasse BÃ¶rjes posted an Olympic record of 39.69, which was considered a formidable time. But Keller bettered it in the third pair, finishing in 39.44, and these two would eventually win the gold and silver medals, as Keller defended his title. Muratov was in the next pairing and his 39.80 brought him the bronze medal. Schenk was in the fifth pair and although anticipation was high, he fell early and although he got and finished the race, he wound up in 34th place. Linkovesi skated next but his 40.14 earned him only sixth place.
Keller was one of the great sprinters of his era. In his career he would set four world records at 500 metres, one in the 1,000 m, and one in the sprint all-around. In addition to his two Olympic golds in this event, he won the distance at the 1968 and 1970 World Winter Universiade, the 1969-70 European Championships, and one race at the 1971 World Sprints. BÃ¶rjes was also a top sprinter, setting four 500 m world records and winning eight 500s and three 1,000s at major internationals.

In addition, he had broken the 34-second barrier, setting a world record of 33.98 in November 2015. In 2016, he was suspended for use of the stimulant meldonium as one of many Russians to suffer that fate. His suspension was lifted as WADA acknowledged uncertainties about how long meldonium remains in the body. His 2016/2017 season, however, was negatively impacted by the affair, compounded by injury. He returned in the Olympic season, although not as dominant as before, but would not go to the Olympics. He was one of many Russian athletes barred from competed due to their doping history; Kulizhnikov had been disqualified from the World Junior Championships in 2012 after adverse analytical findings. Also missing from the field was fellow Russian Pavel Murashov, as well as the defending Olympic champion, Michel Mulder, who had failed to qualify for the Dutch team. With them out of the picture, the race was open. Four more riders had won World Cups in the running season: HÃ¥vard Holmefjord Lorentzen, Laurent Dubreuil, Alex Boisvert-Lacroix and Ronald Mulder, while 2017 World Champion and 2014 runner up Jan Smeekens was also considered a contender.
Most of the favorites, however, did not deliver in the race, leaving room for outsiders to mount the podium. Gao Tingyu, whose best World Cup result had been fifth, set the first competitive mark at 34.65. To the delight of the crowd, home skater Cha Min-Kyu bettered this mark with 34.42, also bettering the track record. Cha had been second in a World Cup earlier in the season, but had mostly featured further down the rankings. The only skater to surpass Gao and Cha was Lorentzen. The Norwegian, winner of three World Cup races during the season, managed to silence the Korean crowds, as he equalled his personal best mark of 34.41. A private video of his brother HÃ¥kon (professional football player for Sandeford) following the race and yelling him on later made the rounds on social media and television. The gold medal was the first in the event by a Norwegian since Finn Helgesen in 1948, while Gao was the first Chinese man to win a medal in Olympic speed skating.

Although speed skating had always been contested by all-around skaters, by the late 1960s it was becoming more common for skaters to specialize either as sprinters or distance skaters. One such skater was German Erhard Keller who had competed at the 1966 and 1967 World Championships, but came to the fore as a sprinter in early 1968, winning the 500 at the World Winter University Games in January, and later in the month, breaking the world record at Inzell with a time of 39.2. Keller was the favorite with McDermott an unknown factor. The early leader came out of the third pair, Norway Magne Thomassen, who had won the 500 at the 1964 European Championships and finished in 40.5. Five more pairs went thru, and Keller then presented himself in the ninth pair, posting a 40.3 to take the lead. The lead seemed safe, mostly because it was a warm day and the ice was melting, making conditions very difficult for the later skaters. It most affected Terry McDermott, who went off in the 24th, and final, pair. Inexplicably, though no other skater in the last five pairs bettered 41.6, McDermott finished in 40.5 to tie Thomassen for the silver medal. Keller was gracious in victory, stating, âWhat [McDermott] did today was just sheer guts. If he had started in the earlier heats while the ice was still good, Iâd have lost. It as simple as that.â But Keller was no fluke, as he would continue to win sprints over the next five years. He won the 1971 World Sprint championships, and won 500 distance titles at the 1969 and 1970 European Championships, the 1970 World Winter University Games, and in 1972, he would return to the Olympics and defend his gold medal.

At the World Cup in Hamar, in December 1993, he had improved his own world record to 35.92, becoming the first man to go below 36 seconds. He nearly copied that race the next day, skating 35.96. In addition to a few more World Cup wins, he had won both 500 ms at the World Sprint Championships just weeks before the Olympics, winning the overall title as well. His previous rival, 1988 and 1992 champion Uwe-Jens Mey had retired, but he did face strong opposition from Japan and Russia. Of these, Sergey Klevchenya and Yasunori Miyabe had also won World Cup races, with the Russian finishing second at the World Sprint Championships.
With all favourites skating early in the program, Jansen was drawn in the inner lane of the second pair. This meant he had the final outer curve, considered an advantage. Still, he was unable to keep his speed, Jansen needed to correct and briefly touched the ice. He finished in 36.66, already the second time behind Liu Hongbo, and his Olympic dreams seemed over. This left chances for the others. Manabu Horii narrowly beat Liu leading time with 36.53. Then Klevchenya took the ice. He eliminated co-favorite Miyabe in a direct confrontation, also lowering the Olympic Record to 36.39. The only outsider left then was Klevchenya compatriot, Aleksandr Golubev. Known for his quick starts, he departed in 9.58, the best opener of the field. Unlike his races at the World Sprints, Golubev held on the pace and crossed the line a bit sooner than Klevchenya (36.33). The 1-2 by Golubev and Klevchenya meant the first Olympic speed skating medals won by Russia as a separate nation.

Reigning Olympic Champion Lee Sang-Hwa had dominated the event since her somewhat surprising victory in Vancouver. She had won the 2012 and 2013 world titles (2nd in 2011), and since November 2012 had lost only a single 500 m World Cup race. She had beaten the World Record four times in 2013, lowering it from 36.94 to a 36.36. Few other skaters had managed to beat 37 seconds, and Wang Beixing 36.85 was the best time not set by Lee. Wang compatriot Yu Jing, a former World Record holder, was missing in Sochi, suffering from a hip injury. Together with Wang, American skater Heather Richardson, home favorite Olga Fatkulina and former record holder Jenny Wolf of Germany were highly considered for a medal.
The surprise of the first run was Zhang Hong, another Chinese sprinter. Despite a modest 10.79 opening she recorded the fastest full lap and set the third time of the first run with 37.58. Only in pair 16 could Fatkulina beat that time (by 0.01), enthusiastically cheered on by the crowd. As expected, Lee time in the final pair was faster, but with 37.42 the gap was not as large as it had been in earlier competitions. The other favorites were all still in contention as well, and were joined by Margot Boer in 5th and Nao Kodaira in 7th.
Boer was the first of these favorites to hit the ice in the second run, and she slightly improved on her first run mark for a 75.48 total. The time would only be beaten by two skaters in the second run, as Richardson (38.02), Zhang (37.99), Wolf (37.73) and Kodaira (37.72) all had slightly worse times. Fatkulina, however used the crowd energy to power to 37.49. Lee position never seemed in danger, however, and she demonstrated that by finishing in a new Olympic Record of 37.28 - giving 74.70 as her total, another Olympic Record. This made Lee the third woman to retain her Olympic 500 m title, after Bonnie Blair (who won it at three consecutive Olympics) and Catriona Le May Doan.
In May 2016 WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) commissioned a report, the McLaren Report, to look into allegations of systematic Russian doping and a cover-up to avoid positives at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. The report was released in two parts, in July and December 2016, and confirmed the allegations. In 2017 the IOC formed a commission to investigate this, headed by IOC Member Denis Oswald, and usually referred to as the Oswald Commission. In late October 2017 the Oswald Commission began to release its findings.
On 22 November 2017 the silver medalist in this event, Olga Fatkulina was disqualified based on findings from the Oswald Commission. She immediately appealed this ruling to the Court of Abritration for Sport (CAS), and about 10 days before the PyeongChang Winter Olympics began, the CAS reached a decision and Fatkulina was exonerated and her silver medal was restored.

She was fired soon and picked up the sport again 7 months before the Games. Meanwhile, her rivals had continued normally. China Zhang Yanmei improved the World Record during the 1993 World Championships in Beijing, although the distance was eventually won by the overall World Champion, Nathalie Lambert.
Turner already had a reputation for being an aggressive skater - âcompetitiveâ in her own words - and she displayed this again at the Lillehammer Games. In the quarter-finals, Turner bumped several times into Lambert, sending her into the boards and out of contention. While Lambert named Turner âthe dirtiest woman on skatesâ, the American continued unabashedly. She survived a fall in the semis (for which Isabelle Charest was disqualified), and made it into the final. Zhang led the decider with two laps to go, when Turner made a move to pass her. In doing so, she clearly touched the Chinese woman, who claimed Turner had grabbed her. But the referees had not seen anything, and the result was allowed to stand, much to the chagrin of Zhang. Already angered by their disqualification during the relay, she stomped away from the victory ceremony as soon as the U.S. national anthem had finished, throwing away her flowers in anger.
The IOC was not pleased with Zhang display, for which the Chinese later apologized. However, most of the other skaters seemed to agree with Zhang, as a Belgian proposal to allow referees to see television replays at the upcoming World Championships was quickly signed by all team leaders, except for the Americans. Some opponents took it even further, sending Turner hate mail through the Olympic Village messaging system.

Except for a fall in one 500 at the 1974 World Sprints, she had lost only one international 500 since the 1972 Winter Olympics, and only a week before the Olympics, had set her second 500 world record with 40.91 at Davos. She was heavily favored in Innsbruck. Her biggest challengers were expected to be Soviet Tayana Averina, who had set two world records at the distance, and her teammate, Leah Poulos, who had won the 1974 World Sprints when Young had fallen in one race. Of the favorites, Young was the first to start, in the fifth pair, and she recorded 42.76 to move into the lead ahead of Canada Cathy Priestner, who had skated in the pair before her and posted 43.12. Poulos started in the eighth pair, but could not match either time, finishing in 43.21, which would eventually place her fourth. In the next pair, Soviet Vera Krasnova put a scare into Young with a very fast 100 in 10.64, 0.18 ahead of Young start, but she could not maintain that pace and would finish fifth. When Averina finished the 12th pairing in 43.17, the medals were set, with Young winning as expected, Priestner getting silver, and Averina the bronze. A few weeks later, Young would win all four races at the 1976 World Sprints. She was also a cycling sprint champion, winning the women sprint at the 1973 World Championships, finishing third in 1975, and she would again win the World Championship in the cycling sprint later in 1976 and in 1981.

US skater Erin Jackson is a former inline speed skater, having won seven medals at World Championships in the sport. After trying ice speed skating for the first time in 2016, she seriously converted the following year. After only a few months in the sport, she qualified for the 2018 Olympics, where she finished in 24th place in the 500 m.
At the 2019 Worlds, she improved to 15th and then was seventh at the 2020 edition. Choosing not to attend the âCOVID bubbleâ of Heerenveen in 2021, she emerged as one of the surprises when the World Cups resumed with a full field in the 2021/22 season. She won the first three World Cup races of the season, adding a fourth in Salt Lake City, as well as two more podium finishes.
These performances made Jackson one of the pre-Games favorites, but she still had to place among the top two at the US Olympic Trials. Midway through her race, she had an unusual miss-stroke, briefly losing pace and finishing in third. Normally, this would have cost her a spot at the Olympic Games, but teammate Brittany Bowe, who had won the trial race, decided to give up her spot. Long-time friend Bowe, like Jackson, hailed from the Florida town of Ocala, and both had learned inline speed skating there as children.
Although Bowe gesture ultimately had no effect on herself (she was allowed to skate the 500 m after the US was granted a third quota spot), the action was widely praised, including naturally by Jackson herself.
In Beijing, Jackson produced a fitting conclusion to her journey. Racing in the penultimate pair, she clocked 37.04, good enough for a gold medal. This made her the first female Black skater to become Olympic champion, and only the second Black skater after Shani Davis. Joining her on the podium were the surprising Miho Takagi, who had earlier won silver in the 1,500 m, and 2021 World Champion Angelina Golikova. Plagued by back injuries earlier in the season, 2019 World Champion Vanessa Herzog recorded a second consecutive fourth place. With her victory Jackson also became the first Black individual gold medalist at the Winter Olympics, in any sport.

Henning had set the three most recent world records, two in 1971 in Inzell, and most recently, recording 42.5 at Davos in January 1972.  At the 1971 World Sprints she had won both 500s and won the 500 distance at the 1971 World Championships. Titova started in the fourth pair and posted 44.45 to take the lead. Henning was in the next pair with Canada Sylvia Burka. Henning got off very quickly and was even with Burka at the changeover. But Burka, with poor vision in one eye, did not see Henning and impeded her. Henning held up briefly to avoid a collision, even standing up a bit, but then raced madly to the finish, recording 43.73. Burka was disqualified and Henning was allowed a re-start. In her second run, she bettered her own time, finishing in 43.33. Either of her runs would have won the gold medal. In the sixth pair, East Germany Ruth Budzisch was considered a threat, as she had won the 1971 World Sprint Championship. But she was better in the 1,000 and her time of 45.78 would place her only 13th. In the 11th pair, Soviet Vera Krasnova came through in 44.01 to earn the silver medal, moving Titova back to bronze.

A former figure skater, in 1980, she was quite unknown until a few weeks before the Olympics when she won the World Sprints. But by the time of the 1984 Winter Olympics she was the best speed skater in the world. She had won the World Sprints again in 1981 and 1983, and was all-around World Champion in 1982 and 1984, finishing second in 1981 and 1983. She was favored in this event, and already had won the 1,500 in Sarajevo the day before the 500. One challenge was expected to come from her teammate Christa Rothenburger, who in 1983 at Medeo, had set the world record with 39.69. The first four pairs had no major favorites, with the leader at that point Soviet Nataliya Shive, who had crossed in 41.50. Rothenburger went off in the fifth pair and crushed that mark, posting 41.02 on the slow Sarajevo ice. Enke was in the next pair. But her start was quite slow for her, 11.09 to Rothenburger 10.84, and that start time was only the sixth fastest of the competition. Enke could never quite recover from the slow start, and finished in only 41.28. Nobody else came close and Rothenburger had the gold medal in an upset, with Enke holding on for silver, and Shive getting the bronze.
Rothenburger and Enke would come back and medal in the 500 again in Calgary in 1988. But they would finish 2-3 behind American Bonnie Blair, who would win this event in 1988-1992-1994. Blair skated in Sarajevo, finishing eighth in 42.53. In 1986, Rothenburger would win the world sprint cycling championship, and finish second in that event in 1987. She would also win an Olympic silver medal in sprint cycling at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. In her Olympic career, Rothenburger would win five Olympic medals â one in cycling and four in speed skating, adding a bronze in this event in 1992 and winning the 1,000 at the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics.

But in the 500 m, Radanova had proven herself as a force to be reckoned with. In October 2001, she had bettered the world record in the event during World Cup competition. Another title favorite would have been Yang Yang (S), but she was not selected in this event, the coaches favoring Wang Chunlu instead.
Yang [A], who had been under pressured to win China first Winter Olympic gold medal in the 1,500 m, had disappointed in that event, finishing only fourth. But this had given her courage, and she easily made the final in the 500 m, where she led from start to finish.

She had emerged as dominant in the event in the previous season, and had won all 15 World Cup races she had contested since then. In addition, she had won the 2017 World title, and the 2017 World Sprint Championships. The Korean public hoped that Lee Sang-Hwa might be able to challenge her, and win her third Olympic 500 m title after 2010 and 2014.

By the time Kodaira took to the ice, the leading time (37.53) had been produced by Brittany Bowe, but Kodaira was not impressed by that, and lowered it by almost six tenths of a second to 36.94. This brought down the Olympic Record (previously 37.30) by a massive margin as well. In her slipstream, ErbanovÃ¡ finished in 37.34, also below Bowe mark. Lee then mounted a serious attempt at retaining her gold, opening in 10.20 (the fastest of the field), but it was insufficient to beat Kodaira mark (37.33), and only barely faster than ErbanovÃ¡. In the final pair, Herzog launched a last attempt to break into the medal positions, but unsuccessfully. Kodaira gold medal was the first in speed skating for a Japanese woman, and only the second total (the first one by Hiroyasu Shimizu).

Wolf had been the strongest 500 m skater since the 2006 Games, claiming the World Championship and the World Cup in the next three seasons. Wolf was also the fastest skater, with a world record of 37.00 seconds and seven of the ten fastest times recorded. Two of the other top-10 times had been set by Wang, three times runner-up to Wolf at the World Championships, but Wang had beaten Wolf at the 2009 World Sprint Championships, and twice during the ongoing World Cup season. Shortly before the Games, a third contender appeared. Already considered the âbest of the restâ for some time, South Korean Lee Sang-Hwa finally managed to beat Wolf in one of the 500 ms at the World Sprint Championships, where she also took the overall title.
One of the other medal contenders, Annette Gerritsen of the Netherland was already out of contention in the first run, as she crashed out of the race in the first curve. At that point, Wang had taken the lead with a somewhat disappointing 34.487. Wolf was expected to beat this, which she did with 38.307. But in that race, Lee passed Wolf in the final straight to create a gap of about 0.05 seconds.
This left the competition wide open for the second run. It soon turned out that ice conditions had much improved. Wang considerably bettered her own first run time, and even bettered Lee mark with her 38.144, ensuring a bronze medal. The final pair between Lee and Wolf was an exciting one. Wolf recorded one of her stunning opening times (10.14), making up for the difference from the first race. But as in the first run, Lee drew closer.

In Hamar, Blair came quite close to her own world record, despite that being set at the fast high-altitude rink in Calgary. With 39.25, she won by a large margin.

Four years earlier, she had missed the Olympics due to a doping offense at the World Sprint Championships. In Albertville she declared this was due to drugs given to her by the team doctor, whom she had trusted.

Karin Kania won the World Sprint Championships in 1980-81, 1983-84, and 1986-87, while her compatriot Christa Rothenburger had taken the title in 1985 and 1988 - a week before the Olympics. In recent years, the duo had gotten competition from American Bonnie Blair, with the three occupying the podium at the past three World Sprint Championships, and dividing the medals in both 500 ms at the 1988 edition in West Allis. The trio had also divided the World Cup races of the season thus far: Kania had won one, Rothenburger and Blair two. To clarify that these three were the absolute favorites, they had all three held the world record in recent years. In 1983, Rothenburger had been the first to go below 40 seconds. She lost her record to Kania in 1986, who in turn lost it to Blair, in 1987. At the Calgary World Cup in December 1987, Rothenburger took the record back, setting the mark at 39.39.
Of the three title contenders, Rothenburger was the first to compete. In the second pair, she lowered the Olympic Record (set by Andrea Ehrig in the previous race at 40.71) by more than 1.5 seconds: 39.12 - a world record. Blair then took off in heat four. Her 100 m split, 10.55, was 0.02 faster than Rothenburger. That would prove to be enough to beat the East German, as Blair then copied the full lap time of Rothenburger, to finish in 39.10, again bettering the world record. As usual, Kania had a slower start than the two leaders, but was expected to have a better lap. She did, but it was not enough to overtake the two leaders. As expected, none of the others came within half a second of the winning time.

At the past editions of the World Championships, Wang had placed 2nd (2003), and 1st (2004, 2005), and she had won four World Cup races in the Olympic season. By contrast, Zhurova best years had been long before, winning the 500 m world title back in 1996 (and placing second in 1999). However, she had made a strong comeback in the 2005/2006 season, winning her first World Cup races in years, and unexpectedly winning the 2006 World Sprint Championships ahead of Wang. Other medal contenders were 16-year-old Lee Sang-Hwa of South Korea, and Jenny Wolf of Germany.
Known for her fast openers, Wolf started against Zhurova in the first heat, with the fastest 100 m of the pack (10.39), but Zhurova lap was much stronger, to finish in 38.23. Her time remained unmatched in the remaining pairs, with Wang coming closest at 38.31. Next were Tomomi Okazaki, the 1998 bronze medalist from Japan, and Ren Hui (China), who had been in silver medal position at the 2005 Worlds, before falling in the second run. In 6th and 7th, Wolf and Lee appeared out of contention already.
The final pairs of the second run started with Ren against Wolf. With a sound lap, the Chinese neared the time of Zhurova from the first run, with 38.27. This left Okazaki with a hard target for the bronze medal, and she just failed to get it, missing out by 0.05 seconds. The final pair was between the two leaders, Wang and Zhurova. Nearly equal at the bell, Zhurova edged away in the final straight to 38.34. That time was not enough to win the second heat, but good enough for a long awaited gold medal, ahead of the two Chinese sprinters, Wang and Ren.

In the longer distance events, the gold medals were conceded to Lidiya Skoblikova, the 1963 World Champion. She had won gold medals at the 1960 Winter Olympics in the 1,500 and 3,000, and at the 1963 Worlds, had won all four distances. But the short nature of the 500 left it more open to upsets than the longer races. The world record holder was another Soviet, Inga Voronina, but she had failed to make the Soviet team due to a stomach ailment.
After the pair had false started. Irina Yegorova of the Soviet Union started in the first pair and posted an Olympic record 45.4. There were 28 starters and 14 pairs, and Yegorova mark lasted for a long time, as Skoblikova was not scheduled until the 13th pair. Skoblikova started in 11.5 to Yegorova 11.4, but her strength then brought her around in 45.0, the second fastest time ever, winning her the gold medal. The Soviets swept the medals with Tatyana Sidorova finishing in 44.5. This was the first ever medal sweep in Olympic speed skating, although the Norwegian men would match it six days later in the 5,000 m. Yegorova was a top sprinter, who had won a pre-Olympic test on 26 January, defeating Skoblikova in the process. She had been second in the 500 at the 1963 World Championships, and would win it at the 1964 and 1966 Worlds. Skoblikova was on her way, winning her third Olympic gold medal, and would sweep all four distances in Innsbruck. A few weeks later she would win the 1964 World Championships, and would win all four distances there as well, tying Yegorova for first in the 500.

Three members of their team competed in PyeongChang: Linn Persson, Mona Brorsson, and Hanna Ãberg. The team was completed with Hanna younger sister Elvira Ãberg. The ROC team took the silver medal with Germany taking the bronze.
The first German runner, Vanessa Voigt, did a good job and gave a courageous performance in what was her first World Cup season and Winter Olympics dÃ©but. Voigt handed over as the leader, ahead of Sweden (0.5 seconds) and Italy (1.5 seconds). On the second leg, Vanessa Hinz had to reload twice for the last shot of the standing shooting and dropped to fourth place. Kristina Reztsova was first at the second exchange for the ROC with Italy Dorothea Wierer in second place.
Despite reloading four times, Hanna Ãberg took the lead on the third leg. Italy youngest competitor, Samuela Comola, held on to second place. Svetlana Mironova had to go a penalty loop and dropped to third place. Germany started in fourth place, 45.9 seconds behind. Franziska PreuÃ, who could not compete for about two months prior to the Games due to an injury and COVID-19 infection, maintained their fourth place.
Elvira Ãberg started the anchor leg with a lead of 26 seconds, and the Swede secured the gold medal, reloading just once in the final standing shooting. Federica Sanfilippo for Italy lost almost 90 seconds to the top teams and fell out of the medal ranking, finishing fifth. Uliana Nigmatullina had to reload just once, and took silver for the ROC. Olympic champion Denise Herrmann, Germany final runner, could never close the gap but was happy with bronze.
Heavy favourites Norway lost all chances early in the race, when their second runner, Tiril Eckhoff had to go two penalty loops and added 1:40 to Norway deficit, which was too much for the last two competitors to claw back.

Olga Zaitseva, despite missing 3 targets in the final leg, brought the Russian team home in the time of 1-09:36.3 to win the gold medal comfortably. A good leg from Sandrine Bailly saw her overtake Andrea Henkel in the last leg to win the silver medal for France ahead of Germany. The Russian victory was not without controversy. Olga Medvedtseva, then competing under the name Olga Pylyova, had been an Olympic champion in Salt Lake City but was thrown out of the 2006 Winter Games after testing positive for the drug Carphedon which is claimed to increase physical stamina and tolerance to cold.

For some time disqualifying the German team was discussed by the officials. The tragic figure was first leg runner Franziska PreuÃ, who hit all five targets in her first round of shooting, but thought she had missed a shot. She reloaded a cartridge, but did not shoot when she noticed her miscalculation. The jury did not disqualify her, but at the second shooting she then missed four targets and had to run a penalty loop.
The event ended up being very close, with only 64 seconds separating gold medal winning Belarus from ninth-placed Italy. Belarus never led until the final leg, when their anchor skier Darya Domracheva pulled ahead of France AnaÃ¯s Bescond and won the event by 10.7 seconds over Sweden, led by their anchor Hanna Ãberg, who pulled them from eighth place after three legs with the fastest leg of the entire relay, marked by perfect shooting. Bescond and France held on for the bronze medal, with Norway finishing fourth. Italy had been third after three legs, but Federica Sanfilippo struggled both skiing and shooting as they dropped back to ninth.
Domracheva won her fourth gold medal, after three in Sochi, and replaced Germany Kati Wilhelm and Slovkaia Anastasia Kuzmina, both with three golds, as the most successful female biathletes in Olympic history in terms of gold medals. Wilhelm was the color commentator for this race on German TV.

Ukraine had won a silver medal at the 2013 World Championships, but was only thought to have a shot at bronze. But improbably Ukraine came through for the gold medal in a stirring victory. It came shortly after civil unrest in Kyiv had rocked the political world, and IOC President Thomas Bach and Ukrainian IOC Member Sergey Bubka had both called for a halt to violence in the country.
Ukraine took the lead on the second leg as Yuliya Dzhyma shot cleanly to move ahead. She handed Valj Semerenko a 12.1 second lead, which she increased to 28.4 seconds, as anchor skiier Olena Pidhrushna took over. Pidhrushna brought Ukraine home in first, with Russia winning the silver medal (but see below) and Norway the bronze. Ukraine victory was a true team effort, as none of their skiiers had the best or second-best performance on any leg, but all of them were either third or fourth for the legs, showing the most consistency of any team.
Germany had a disastrous performance, finishing 11th, as opening skiier Franziska PreuÃ broke a ski pole, and then after falling, had to clean her rifle before shooting, which had become clogged with snow during the fall. This cost her almost 3 minutes, and she was only 16th after her leg, and the Germans could never make up the time.
The results were altered after the Oswald Commission and the McLaren Report came out in December 2016. Initially, three of the Russian skiiers were disqualified - Yana Romanova, Olga Zaytseva, and Olga Vilukhina - disqualifying the entire team. However, Romanova and Vilukhina were reinstated after appeals, but Zaytseva remained disqualified as did the team. After appeals at the Tribunal FÃ©dÃ©ral of Switzerland it was not until 2022 that Norway was officially moved up to a silver medal and Czechia to a bronze medal.

The relay was re-scheduled to an earlier start by two and a half hours to avoid the freezing cold weather. Even so, it was -15 degrees at the start. Under difficult weather conditions, of the top 10 teams, only France got away without a penalty loop.
The ROC took an early lead through Said Karimulla Khalili, with Belarus less than a second behind, and France third. The favourites Norway were 40.3 seconds behind in seventh place due to Sturla Holm LÃ¦greid penalty loop. Aleksandr Loginov and Maksim Tsvetkov helped increase the ROC lead to 41.3 seconds after the second and third legs. France held on to second place with a narrow lead over Norway, thanks to Johannes Thingnes BÃ¸ bringing them back into the reckoning. Norway trailed by 1:47.6 after the second leg until BÃ¸ ran the best third leg, making up more than one minute on the leaders. Benedikt Doll moved Germany into fourth place going into the last exchange thanks to his time being the second-best of the third leg.
With Eduard Latypov running a lonely race for ROC, Vetle SjÃ¥stad Christiansen, Quentin Fillon-Maillet, and Philipp Nawrath were fighting for second place. Drama came in the final standing shooting. Latypov had to go two penalty loops, lost his comfortable lead to Norway, and slipped down to third place. France also took advantage of Latypov mistakes and secured silver. Germany also had a penalty loop and could not close the gap and missed out on a medal behind ROC.

The opening leg was a disaster for East Germany JÃ¼rgen Wirth, who missed three targets and finishing the leg in only 12th place. They were out of the medals and would finish fifth. On the second leg, the Soviets pulled ahead, taking almost a one minute lead over Austria. They would maintain the margin at about a minute to win the gold medal, although West Germany would come on in the last two legs to win silver, with Italy finishing third, and Austria dropping out of the medals in fourth. The first four teams had all their skiers shoot clean rounds throughout, and had no penalty loops. East Germany final three skiers also shot cleanly, and Wirth misses on the opening leg may have cost his team the gold medal.

Russia had come to Sochi looking for multiple medals in biathlon but had struggled. The team benefactor was Russian billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov, who owned the NBA Brooklyn Nets, but as the Games neared their end, Prokhorov said he would resign as President of the Russian Biathlon Union if they did not improve their performance. And that they did by winning the final biathlon gold medal of the Sochi Olympics in the men relay.
Norway took the early lead, with the brothers Tarjei BÃ¸ and Johannes Thingnes BÃ¸ leading after the first two legs. Russia was third, as Germany Erik Lesser moved his team into second. It had been a very disappointing Winter Olympics for the German biathletes, but Daniel BÃ¶hm held onto second after the second leg. Norwegian biathlon legend, Ole Einar BjÃ¸rndalen, looking for his record 14th Winter Olympic medal, skiied the third leg, and shot cleanly. But his skiing was slower than usual, and Arnd Peiffer moved Germany only 2 seconds back, with Russia another 15 seconds behind. Norway anchor leg was Emil Hegle Svendsen, who had won gold in Sochi in the mass start race, but had been sick throughout the Games. He shot very poorly on his leg, missing four targets and dropped completely off the podium as they would finish fourth.
The gold and silver medals came down to a race between the Russian and German anchor skiiers â Anton Shipulin and Simon Schempp. Schempp shot better, needing only 2 extra shots to hit all his targets, to Shipulin 4, but he could not match Shipulin speed over the snow and Shipulin came home in front by 3.5 seconds. Austria won the bronze medal, almost 30 seconds back, with Norway well behind in fourth.
And that was how the results stood until February 2020, when the International Biathlon Union (IBU) disqualified Yevgeny Ustyugov (RUS) after a re-test of samples from 2013 revealed the presence of oxandrolone. As a result, Ustyugov was stripped of all his results from  the 2013-14 season and was disqualified from all five events in which he competed at Sochi. His relay disqualification cost Russia the gold medal. As of July 2020, no upgrade of medals has been announced by the IOC. Ustyugov has an appeal pending with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) as of October 2021, who announced the decision on this will be delayed until 2022.

Norway was expected to be their closest rivals, having won silver behind the Soviets in that period. Finland and East Germany were considered as medal contenders.
The first leg gave some unexpected results. Home favorite Isao Ono hit all his targets and skied fast enough to reach the first exchange 36 seconds ahead of his closest rival, East Germany silver medalist from the individual event, HansjÃ¶rg Knauthe. In third place was another big surprise, Great Britain Malcolm Hirst, only 8 seconds behind East Germany, but closely followed by Sweden and Norway. Finland and the Soviet Union were further behind, as the Soviet lead-off man Aleksandr Tikhonov had to ski two penalty loops and was 1:19 behind the leader.

USA was still doing well in fourth place, but Italy had dropped back to eighth. Finland had started to move and was fifth, over half a minute ahead of Norway.

Out of eight earlier World Championships relays, the Soviet team had won five, but one of their rare losses was at the 1975 World Championships, when Finland was able to defeat the seemingly unbeatable Soviet team.
The 1976 Olympic Biathlon relay developed into a non-thrilling affair regarding the gold and silver medal.

Finland also increased the gap to their pursuers steadily, and was in second place, 1:32 ahead of West Germany, at the last exchange. The fight for the bronze medal developed into a close duel between the two German teams. East Germany anchor leg man, Manfred Geyer started his leg in seventh, 1:43 behind the bronze medal position, but advanced steadily after perfect shooting and caught West Germany just before the finish, reaching the finish just three seconds ahead of his West German rival with the second fastest leg time of the day.

But this time few experts would put their money on the Soviet team. In the individual events, their best placing in the 20 km was a very disappointing 17th place. The sprint was a little better, the three Soviet competitors placing 5-10-11. But they had won the 1983 World Championships with two teenagers on their team, and three of the four team-members from 1983 were on the 1984 Olympic team. East Germany was considered by most experts as favorites, and Norway and West Germany were strong medal contenders.
The Soviets had put their most inexperienced athlete on the first leg, Dmitry Vasilyev, a 21-year-old from Leningrad who was competing in an international biathlon championship for the first time. He had a modest 32nd place from the 20 km race as his only international experience. But Vasilyev did well on his opening leg, giving his team a 1:06 lead over Finland. Czechoslovakia, East Germany and West Germany followed closely, only three seconds separating the teams from second to fifth. Norway was down in ninth place, over two minutes behind the leader. Their opening leg skier, Odd Lirhus, 1978 World Champion in 20 km, had trouble with his second shooting round and had to ski two penalty laps. On the second leg, Yury Kashkarov defended his team lead, but East Germany Frank-Peter Roesch gained over half a minute and was only 26 seconds behind at the exchange. Olympic sprint champion Erik Kvalfoss had brought Norway back into the fight for medals, moving into third, 56 seconds behind the leader, with West Germany in fourth place, 52 seconds behind Norway.
On the third leg, the Soviet Union most experienced man, Algimantas Å alna, ran into trouble on his second shooting round and had to ski two penalty laps. He was overtaken by East Germany Matthias Jacob, who sent anchorman Frank Ullrich out 19 seconds ahead of the Soviet 19-year-old Sergey Bulygin. Peter Angerer had brought West Germany into bronze medal position only 28 seconds behind the leader, but Norway Rolf Storsveen had also done well and was only 44 seconds behind, still in position for a medal. The leading quartet was now at least 3-4 minutes ahead of the rest of the field. Ullrich was clearly, as shown by his individual appearances, in far from his best skiing shape. Norway Kjell SÃ¸bak came strongly from behind, and before the last shooting round the Soviet Union, West Germany and Norway passed Ullrich. The three teams came into the final series of standing shots close together. Young Bulygin showed good nerves and had five hits in a row. SÃ¸bak and West Germany Fritz Fischer had to use two extra shots and left the shooting range together 15 seconds behind Bulygin. The young Siberian fought bravely and secured the Soviet Union their fifth Olympic relay gold in a row, 12 seconds ahead of Norway SÃ¸bak, who was able to keep Fischer 1.2 seconds behind at the finish in a close battle for silver. Frank Ullrich brought East Germany home to a disappointing fourth place, losing over 11/2 minutes to his competitors on his last leg despite a good shooting day. The Olympic relay was Ullrich last appearance as an active biathlete, a sad end to a great career.

The relay was supposed to start in the morning, but it was a very foggy morning in Autrans, and the race had to be postponed until the afternoon.
Aleksandr Tikhonov was clearly the fastest skier on the first leg, and in spite of a penalty lap he brought the Soviet Union into a clear lead, 45 seconds ahead of Sweden. Norway in third place was 1:43 behind and seemingly too far behind to fight for the gold medal.

The Unified Team was favored in the absence of the defunct Soviet Union.

And for the first two legs, the chalk looked good, as Germany led the opening leg, followed by Russia, and they pulled further ahead on the second leg, leading Russia by 1:11.2 at the second exchange. But on the third leg German Simone Greiner-Petter-Memm missed six of her 10 targets, and 12 of 16 shots overall, and was forced to ski 900 metres in penalty loops, posting a time of 30:43.1, slowest by any biathlete on the top seven teams. This dropped Germany to third, but over 21/2 minutes behind Russia, and the gold medal chase was over.

She had won two titles at the 2001 World Championships but the sprint championship had been won German Kati Wilhelm. Wilhelm was a cross-country skier at the 1998 Winter Olympics, but her best finish of 16th in the 30 km led her to switch to biathlon. She was the 18th starter, the first of the favorites to go off, and shot cleanly throughout to finish in 20:41.4. In the 37th start spot, the 1998 silver medalist, Uschi Disl, finished in 20:57.0, missing one target, which cost her the gold medal that would go to Wilhelm.
Forsberg started 58th of 74 starters, but also missed one target, and ended up in third. Salt Lake City would not be kind to her. Considered by most as the greatest female biathlete ever, she would end her career with only two Olympic bronze medals, having already placed third in the 15 km individual event. After winning six overall World Cup titles, and six gold medals at the World Championships, and holding the record for the most World Cup events wins, she would retire after the 2002 season.

In 1997-98 they were again 1-2 in the World Cup coming into Nagano. But both Romasko and Forsberg would miss three targets and eventually finish 17th and 27th respectively. Germany Katrin Apel started second, missed one target, and her 23:32.4 would lead for about half the race. But the 33rd starter was Russian Galina Kukleva, who finished in 23:08.0, also missing one target. Disl was two starters behind and was right on Kukleva pace throughout. As she crossed the line, she fell forward and Kukleva, who was watching closely, helped her up. When they looked at the scoreboard, Disl had just missed the gold, finishing 7/10ths behind Kukleva, with Apel time holding on for the gold.
Disl was in the midst of a great career. From 1992-2005 she won eight World Championships and 19 medals at the Worlds. She eventually won nine Olympic medals, including two golds in the relay in 1998 and 2002, but never won an individual Olympic gold. Apel would also win numerous international medals, with three golds and nine medals at the World Championships, and four Olympic medals, including two relay golds. For Kukleva, Nagano was the highlight of her career, as she added a relay silver to her gold medal in this race.

At the start, Harvey Cohn took the lead, followed by Emil Breitkreutz and German Johannes Runge, with Lightbody running last in the early going.  At the 400 metre mark, Runge took over the lead, as Cohn flagged badly, and Lightbody began a sustained drive, passing the entire field on the outside.  Coming into the final stretch, Breitkreutz and George Underwood led, but Lightbody was gaining fast.  He eventually pulled away to win by two yards, with Breitkreutz holding onto second until the last yards.  He was then passed by Howard Valentine, who closed quickly. This was probably the top race of the 1904 Olympics, as several runners were so badly spent they were carried from the track in exhaustion.

Kiely was fifth after four events but then his great strength in the weight throws pulled him into the lead after the eighth event and he held on to win. The individual event marks for all competitors were below par, mostly due to the conditions as the all-around was contested on a day that it rained continuously and the track was noted to be flooded at various locations and muddy throughout.
There has been some controversy in the Journal of Olympic History as to whether this was an Olympic event.  Decathlon expert Frank Zarnowski leads the naysayers, but the IOC continues to recognize this as an Olympic event. In addition, photos exist of Kiely medal, which contains the term âOlympic Gamesâ above the ribbon holding the medal. A trophy was also made for Kiely to celebrate his victory which contains the term âOlympic Games, St. Louis, U.S.A.â on it.

He led two International Himalaya Expeditions, one in 1930 and one in 1934. The aim of the first was to climb Kangchenjunga â the third highest mountain in the world. Although that objective was not met, several geological and medical experiments had been useful, and the expedition was widely publicized. Additionally, members of the expedition reached the top of the Jongsong, which at 7,462 m was the highest peak to have been climbed at the time.
An important member of the expedition had been Oskar wife, Hettie Dyhrenfurth (nÃ©e Heymann). With the rise of the Nazi party in the early 1930s, the Jewish couple decided to apply for Swiss citizenship. Their 1934 expedition led them to the Gasherbrum ()Hidden Peak)), reaching 6,900 m, and the Sia Kangri. At the latter mountain, Hettie reached 7,442 m, setting a new world altitude record for women which she only lost to Claude Kogan in 1954.
The Dyhrenfurths were unanimously awarded the gold medal for alpinism, citing their expeditions to the Himalaya, although technically only the 1934 expedition was eligible. This decision was remarkable as the Germans probably didnât like their former citizens winning this award. As a result, the prize was barely mentioned in any German or even Swiss publications, much to the chagrin of Oskar Dyhrenfurth.

Led by Brigadier Charles Bruce , it had set out to climb the world highest mountain, Mount Everest, on the Chinese-Nepali border. In three attempts, the expedition failed to reach the summit, and on the third attempt seven Sherpas died in an avalanche. In his speech, Pierre de Coubertin explained why the medal had been awarded to the expedition:
âFor the first time a gold medal is awarded for alpinism, and it is awarded to the glorious expedition to the Mount Everest. Not content with having almost succeeded, they are preparing a renewed effort to finish the ascent.
Mr. Representative of the mission, we welcome your presence for the beautiful heroism displayed. At the foot of the highest mountain in Europe, we present you and your wonderful companions with this small testimony of the admiration with which all nations have followed your journey towards the untouched peaks of the highest mountain in the world. We accompany this gesture by prayers for the completion of a work that will honor not only your country but all humanity.â
The awards were received by Lieutenant Colonel Bill Strutt, as Bruce was unavailable due to preparations for another expedition, starting in February. The second attempt to climb the 8,448 m-high mountain would also fail, and 1922 participant George Mallory would not survive an attempt to reach the peak. But his ultimate fate was only fully known in 1999, when his body was found after 75 years.
Several question marks surround this event. It is not known if there were any other nominations other than the winners of the gold medal. Secondly, it is unclear if all members received a medal, or if just one was awarded for the entire expedition - sources are unclear on this. Finally, we do not know all the names of the expedition members. The names of the Western participants are known, as are those of one Nepalese guide and the Sherpas that perished during the expedition, but some 160 people were supposedly involved.

But nobody had yet ascended via the north face of the mountain, via a huge wall. Two German brothers, who had cycled from MÃ¼nchen, decided to climb it, but had not publicly announced it. The two brothers, Franz and Toni Schmid, managed to master the rock wall, reaching the top on 1 August 1931. The IOC decided to award this performance with a gold medal during its session at the Los Angeles Olympics in 1932. German IOC member Theodor Lewald accepted the prize in the absence of the two climbers. On 5 September 1932, Lewald handed out the prize in a special ceremony in MÃ¼nchen. The younger brother, Toni had already died before the Los Angeles Olympics, falling to his death while attempting to climb the Wiesbachhorn in the Austrian Hohe Tauern, so his medal was presented to their father. Toni was an educated construction engineer, Franz became a police inspector in Neuhaus in Schliersee.
At their trip to the Matterhorn in 1931, the Schmids had been accompanied by two friends, who decided at the last minute not to climb with them due to bad weather. Both of them would still find their place in Olympic history, though. Besides remaining a noted mountaineer, Hans Ertl became cameraman (and, allegedly, lover) of controversial and influential director Leni Riefenstahl. Among others, he was the chief cameraman for Olympia, her two-part masterpiece about the 1936 Olympics. Franz had also climbed the north face of the Ortler together with Hans Ertl on 22 June 1931. At the 1936 Games, the fourth friend was also involved: Ernst Krebs won a gold medal in the 10,000 m K1 (kayak). In 1998, German journalist Imke Habegger described the ascent of the north wall in their article on 31 December in the âGeneral-Anzeigerâ of Bonn: Sleepless on the Icy Rock Needle. The Munich Brothers Franz and Toni Schmid Conquered the Dangerous North Face of the Matterhorn.

Vakhonin went on to win multiple international titles but never competed again at the Olympics, as he was removed from the Soviet team prior to the 1968 Olympics for âconduct unbecoming a Master of Sport.â Imre FÃ¶ldi had one of the great careers of any weightlifter in the 1960s. He competed at five Olympics (1960-76), winning silver medals in this class in 1964-68 and a gold medal in 1972, and won the 1965 World Championship and four European Championships (1963, 1968, 1970-71). At the end of the 20th century, he was voted the second greatest weightlifter of all-time in several polls, trailing Turkey Naim SuleymanoÄlu.

His closest competitor was thought to be Valentin Xristov of Azerbaijan, reigning European Champion and bronze medalist at the most recent World Championships. Before either weightlifter even had a chance to compete, however, they had already lost the gold medal. Wu and Xristov, competing in the âAâ group, were unable to reach the bar set by Om Yun-Chol of North Korea in the âBâ pool, which was usually reserved for participants outside of the top ten. Om, who had never medalled in a major international competition, became the fifth man ever to lift three times his own bodyweight with a lift of 168 kg in the clean and jerk, beating the Olympic record by 1 kilogram and tying the world one, both set by Halil Mutlu of Turkey. Although he would only have the joint sixth-highest lift in the snatch after all competitors had gone, his total lift was never surpassed.
Wu did not attempt to challenge Om on his first lift. Having won the snatch portion with a weight of 133 kg, he needed a lift of 160 kg, the same as Om first lift, to move into gold medal position. He called for 156 kg, enough to move into second place, but even in this he was unsuccessful until his second attempt. There was a potential for Khalil Maaoui of Tunisia to challenge for gold as well, as he had lifted only one kilogram less than Wu in the snatch, but he withdrew from the clean and jerk before his attempt. Xristov, who had been relegated to bronze following Wu lift, failed at 158 kg, and was surpassed by Vietnam Tráº§n LÃª Quá»c ToÃ n, who lifted 159 kg in his second attempt. Xristov, with a 2 kilogram advantage in the snatch, responded with a 159 kg lift of his own that went unanswered by Tráº§n, who failed at a final attempt at 162 kg. Wu failed in his attempt at 161 kg, which would have been sufficient for the gold, meaning that no one was able to top even Om first lift in the clean and jerk.

Imre FÃ¶ldi, whoâd missed the 1968 gold on bodyweight only, had been victorious at the 1970 and 1971 European Championshps. The defending bronze medallist, Henryk TrÄbicki, had not won any titles since Mexico, but had been a regular podium visitor.
In the press, both FÃ¶ldi and Nassiri tied the Olympic Record, making 127.5 kg in their third lifts. In the snatch, Nassiri fell behind, failing twice at 105.0 kg, while FÃ¶ldi raised 107.5 (as well as Chetin and TrÄbicki). The snatch was won by Japan Koji Miki, whose competition lift was 112.5 kg. But in an out-of-competition attempt to break the world record, he improved his own mark from 113.5 kg to 114.0 kg. While Miki played no role in the overall classification, FÃ¶ldi enjoyed a 5 kg lead over TrÄbicki, with Nassiri and Chetin tied for third. In his first clean & jerk, Nassiri cleared 142.5 kg, 5 kg better than FÃ¶ldi. He next set out to raise 152.5 kg, which would give him the lead. But both his remaining lifts were faulty, while FÃ¶ldi assured his victory by improving to 142.5 as well, making for an overall world record total of 377.5 kg. Meanwhile, Chetin passed TrÄbicki for the bronze medal.
The lifter placing 12th, Soviet-born Israeli Zeâev Friedman, would become one of the victims of the kidnapping by the Palestinian Black September group. Friedman was killed in the firefight at FÃ¼rstenfeldbruck Air Base, in a failed attempt to rescue the hostages.

He took the lead early in London with a press of 105.0 kg, which gave him a 12.5 kg lead over Britain Abe Greenhalgh. After the snatch DePietro led Tom and Britain Julian Creus by 17.5 kg, and all he needed to do was lift cleanly in the clean & jerk to clinch the gold. His lift of 112.5 in the clean & jerk was bettered by four lifters, but it was enough to give DePietro the gold medal and a world record. In the final lift, Creus outlifted Tom to garner the silver medal. DePietro came back in 1949 to place third at the World Championships, which were won by Iran Mahmoud Namdjou, who placed fifth in London.

American championships in this unusual event were held through 1953, but it has never been popular in other nations.
There were only four competitors in 1932 â three Americans and one Mexican gymnast. The US swept the medals, with George Roth winning gold ahead of Phil Erenberg and Bill Kuhlemeier. The athletes swung two Indian clubs of .70 kg (1.5 lbs), for a minimum of four minutes duration.

In the World Cup, the last event was held on 1 March 2020 and was won by 2019 world champion Alexis Pinturault. The reigning world champion from 2021 was Marco Schwarz. Another curiosity was that, to meet the necessary requirements to be eligible to enter this competition, Schwarz and Strolz had to participate in a European Cup downhill at Tarvisio, Italy, in January 2022, in which Schwarz finished 31st and Strolz 39th respectively. On the day before the Beijing race, another downhill training run was held that saw Vincent Kriechmayr in the lead, but he did not compete in the Combined. Asked for the reason, he said that he was testing skiers, probably for his compatriots.
The downhill element took place first, and the start list produced the next interesting fact, as BarnabÃ¡s SzÅllÅs became the first Israeli to open an Alpine skiing event at the Olympics. There were not a lot of downhill specialists entered but, of them, Aleksander Aamodt Kilde set the pace and finished first ahead of Jack Crawford and Brodie Seger. Following in fourth was Johannes Strolz, the first slalom skier, and he was followed by Marco Schwarz. Down in 11th place was Pinturault, equal with SzÅllÅs, already almost two seconds behind Kilde but even more importantly, 1.17 behind Strolz, and 0.97 behind Schwarz.
A change in the rules from 2018 was that after the downhill, the fastest had to start first in the slalom, so the slalom element was opened by Kilde. He put in a good performance and held off Crawford by 0.09 seconds only to be overtaken by the fourth starter Strolz. As none of the others were able to reach the times of the leaders, the podium was already decided. Neither Schwarz nor Murisier caught them and Pinturault did not finish his slalom run. Surprisingly SzÅllÅs, who had only participated in four World Cup races before, and only one of them was a slalom, set the second-best slalom time to finish sixth overall.
Strolz won gold in this event just as his father Hubert Strolz did in 1988. They became the first father and son to do so in Alpine skiing. This triumph was even more remarkable because Johannes Strolz was kicked out of all Austrian national teams before the start of the season as his results were not good enough. He kept fighting, had to pay all his own expenses, including training, and he prepared his skis by himself for every race.
The win also brought manufacturer Head its third gold medal in the third men Alpine skiing event, as well as another bronze, while Atomic took silver. The bronze medal of Crawford was the first ever medal for Canada in this event. With only 17 finishers, the Combined saw the best Alpine skiing results ever for Israel (6th), Ireland (12th), Monaco (13th), and Kosovo (15th), and the best Alpine skiing result ever for a Chinese man (16th). The sixth place also equalled the best ever result for Israel at the Winter Olympics, achieved by the ice dance pair Galit Chait/Sergey Sakhnovsky in 2002.

For the first time at the Winter Olympics the combined event was held on one day, with the downhill in the morning and the slalom in the afternoon. Aamodt placed fourth in the downhill, which was led by American Bode Miller. On the first slalom run, Miller and Aamodt skied cautiously, tying for fifth place. With the second run remaining, Aamodt led, followed by his teammate Lasse Kjus, Austrian Benjamin Raich in third, and Miller back in fifth place. On the final slalom run, Miller attacked the course, with a time more than one second ahead of Raich, who was second on the run, and Aamodt, in fourth on the run, 2.16 seconds back. Aamodt still hung on for the gold medal, though barely, but Miller moved up to second place, with Raich getting the bronze.

The downhill phase was held on the same course as the downhill event five days before but the course was shortened, starting at an altitude of 1,947 metres. The race started between âAccola Valleyâ and âBabya Yamaâ, the first race going off at 1000.
Only two Super Combined events were scheduled during the 2013/14 World Cup and both were held prior to the Games. In Wengen Ted Ligety won in front of Alexis Pinturault while nine days later in KitzbÃ¼hel Pinturault beat Ligety, which meant that these two also topped the Combined scoring for the winter. In former years Ivica KosteliÄ was the dominant racer placing first in the Combined World Cup 2010/11 as well as in 2011/12 and tied with Pinturault in 2012/13. Aksel Lund Svindal was World Champion in 2011, while Ligety won in 2013, with KosteliÄ winning the World Cup Super Combined held as pre-Olympic event in Sochi in February 2012.
Aleksander Kilde, skiing first, set the early downhill target time of 1:53.85. Three starters later the time was bettered by OndÅej Bank (CZE) and, soon afterwards, by Kjetil Jansrud (NOR), who was to set the fastest time of the downhill phase in 1:53.24. Defending champion Bode Miller had a relatively poor race by his standards, placing 12th.
Adam Å½amba (SVK), 27th after the downhill but a slalom specialist, skied what would be the best slalom time of 50.11 to put him in the lead and, eventually take fifth place. People were left wondering whether Å½amba could do the impossible and win, until Sandro Viletta (SUI) produced what would be the second fastest slalom and a combined time of 2:45.20 to lead Å½amba by 1.14 seconds. Miller skied a slightly better slalom, but still finished 0.26 seconds behind Å½amba and was to eventually finish sixth. Viletta first close challenger was to come from an unexpected source, Christof Innerhofer (ITA), a downhill specialist who was silver medallist in his specialist event. Innerhofer was to produce the joint third fastest slalom and finished 0.47 seconds behind Viletta, which appeared to leave the door open for KosteliÄ, but he was a little cautious on the slalom run and finished 0.34 seconds behind Viletta. For KosteliÄ this was his 4th Olympic silver medal, the gold having eluded him so far. The downhill leaders, Bank and Jansrud, were unable to keep their positions and finished seventh and fourth respectively.
Viletta was an unexpected winner as he had only one podium finish in the World Cup with a Super G win in Beaver Creek in December 2011 and his best World Cup Combined result was a fourth place. He became the first Olympic champion (men and women) in Alpine skiing Combined for Switzerland ever and as he used Salomon skis he won the sole gold medal for this manufacturer at Sochi. KosteliÄ, on Fischer skis, won their lone medal in men Alpine events, while Innerhofer won another medal for Rossignol.

Far better as a technical skier, he placed only 13th in the downhill portion of the combined, but won the first run of the slalom to move into the lead. But then on the second slalom run, he straddled a gate and did not finish. The downhill had been led by American Bode Miller, who was having a terrible Olympics, and he continued that trend, not finishing the first slalom run. Behind Raich after the first slalom run were Croatian Ivica KosteliÄ, and surprising American Ted Ligety, who was a slalom specialist, with three podium finishes in World Cup slaloms in 2005-06, but who had only been named to the US National Team in 2005, and had never placed in a combined event on the World Cup circuit. The final slalom run was won by France Jean-Baptiste Grange, who was not a medal contender, having placed only 45th in the downhill and standing 24th going into the second slalom effort. But right behind him was Ligety, which brought him a shocking gold medal. KosteliÄ was only 12th in the second slalom run but held on for the silver medal, with bronze going to Austrian Rainer SchÃ¶nfelder.

As in the days before, wind was still a factor and the start of the downhill phase was lowered for safety reasons, cutting the race short by about 20 seconds. The course was also changed slightly to not so windy parts and avoiding big jumps. The remaining course was more like a Super G, with gusty winds.
The reigning World Champion was Luca Aerni, who won the title at St. Moritz in 2017. He dethroned Austrian Marcel Hirscher, who finished second by 1/100th of a second, after winning gold in 2015. The Frenchman Alexis Pinturault won the Combined Crystal Globe in 2016 and 2017 and won five out of the last nine World Cup Combined events, but had never won a medal in this event at the World Championships or Olympics. In the years 2014 and 2015 no Crystal Globe was awarded, but the scoring was topped by Ted Ligety/Pinturault (shared in 2014) and Carlo Janka. The only two Alpine Combined events held during this World Cup season were won by Pinturault in Bormio and by Victor Muffat-Jeandet in Wengen, but the Crystal Globe was won by Italian Peter Fill, who was able to finish second (Bormio) and third (Wengen). The gold medalist from Sochi Sandro Viletta was not able to participate in PyeongChang, as he tore his right ACL in December 2016 and never fully recovered. The silver medalist from four years ago Ivica KosteliÄ retired in January 2017, with only the bronze medalist Christof Innerhofer returning to the Olympics. Still present at this Games was the gold medalist from 2006, Ted Ligety.
The downhill phase started as scheduled at 1130 with sunshine and blue skies, but with swirling winds and the temperature at -11Â° C. Thomas DreÃen, wearing bib #1, set the fastest time and the best slalom racer, Hirscher, with bib #2, also raced well. Both took the advantage of an early start as the gusts whipped up during a 15-minute delay after the crash of bib #3 Pavel Trikhichev. Also in a good position was Pinturault, finishing 10th and 0.28 seconds ahead of Hirscher.
To give more balance the slalom part was shortened by 10 gates. Muffat-Jeandet set the early pace and took the lead. Ligety, Marco Schwarz, and Thomas Mermillod-Blondin all finished right behind the Frenchman. It was Hirscher who took over the lead from Muffat-Jeandet and also bettered his slalom race time by 1/100th of a second. Two racers later, Pinturault settled in second place and the podium stood. At the end of the result list Albin Tahiri from Kosovo finished in 37th and last position, but made history by becoming the first ever Winter Olympic competitor for his country.
After six Overall World Cup titles and six gold medals at World Championships, Hirscher won his first Olympic gold at his third Games. For Austria it was the first men Combined gold medal since Mario Reiter won gold in Nagano 20 years ago and, for France, it was the first men Combined medals after 70 years, when Henri Oreiller and James Couttet won gold and bronze at St. Moritz in 1948. Hirscher raced Atomic, Pinturault won silver with Head skis, and Muffat-Jeandet used Salomon.

At first it was moved to Friday, but the Super G was scheduled for that day, and the IOC preferred not to postpone races from the original schedule, so the super combined, which differs from the former combined event as only one slalom heat is raced, was contested on Sunday, 21 February.
The favorites were Aksel Lund Svindal, after gold in the Super G and silver in the downhill, he was also the reigning world champion in super combined, and Bode Miller, after a silver in the Super G and bronze in the downhill, and having won the World Cup super combined at Wengen earlier in the winter. Ivica KosteliÄ, who finished the downhill event on Monday in 18th place, and Benjamin Raich were also considered challengers. KosteliÄ won silver at Torino in 2006, had finished third in the 2009-10 World Cup super combined, which finished before Vancouver, and had won the last combined event at KitzbÃ¼hel about one month prior to the Games. Raich had already won the 2009-10 World Cup in the event and had one win at Val dâIsÃ¨re. The first of the four combined events held in the seasonal World Cup was won by Carlo Janka at Beaver Creek. Janka had also won the combined World Cup in 2008-09 and placed second in 2009-10. Silvan Zurbriggen, second in the 2008-09 combined World Cup, and Ted Ligety, gold medalist from Torino, were also given a shot. The 2006 bronze medalist Rainer SchÃ¶nfelder (ACL tear) as well as 2007 World Champion Daniel Albrecht, who had crashed horrifically in the downhill at KitzbÃ¼hel in January 2009, failed to compete in Vancouver.
The downhill saw Aksel Lund Svindal leading with 1:53.15, 0.39 seconds ahead of Dominik Paris and 0.50 seconds ahead of Carlo Janka. Ted Ligety, who finished 15th in the downhill section, set the standard in what would be the fastest slalom time, resulting in a combined time of 2:45.82. His lead held until Ivica KosteliÄ, starting with a 0.86 second advantage ahead of Ligety, raced to a combined time of 2:45.20 on the slalom course designed by his father. Starting two skiers later, Bode Miller skied an almost perfect slalom to take over the lead by 0.33 seconds ahead of KosteliÄ. Silvan Zurbrigen, skiing next, posted a combined time of 2:45.32 to put him into the bronze medal position. The final four skiers were, arguably, more downhill specialists, and had big leads over Miller after the downhill section. The first of the four, downhill gold medallist Didier DÃ©fago went out after missing a gate. Janka threatened for a while, but his time of 2:45.54 finished just outside the medals. The final two skiers, Paris and Svindal, both missed gates and failed to finish, so Bode Miller won his first Olympic gold medal at his third Games. With Miller Head won its third gold medal (and eighth in total) at this Games, while KosteliÄ won the first medal for Fischer with silver and Zurbriggen won bronze for Rossignol.

It was renamed right after Sochi, but the format was still the same with one downhill run and one slalom run. Only one World Cup event was held in the ongoing season in Lenzerheide and it was won by Wendy Holdener, followed by Marta Bassino and Ana Bucik. Holdener was also the 2017 World Champion and the Alpine Combined Crystal Globe winner from 2015/16. The Alpine Combined World Cup winner in 2016/17, Ilka Å tuhec, did not compete in PyeongChang due to an ACL injury to her left knee that she sustained in October 2017. Also not present in South Korea were Tina Maze, 2015 World Champion, and all three medalists from Sochi, as all four had retired. In addition to Holdener, Mikaela Shiffrin, Michelle Gisin, runner-up at the 2017 Worlds, and Petra VlhovÃ¡ were considered medal contenders.
The first phase saw Lindsey Vonn in the lead after the downhill, but she was not considered a medal favorite as she no longer competed or trained for slalom. Following her was Ragnhild Mowinckel in second, but 0.74 seconds behind. From the medal contenders Gisin preformed best, finishing in third place and she was a full 1.21 seconds in front of sixth-placed Shiffrin. Holdener was in 10th, 1.97 seconds behind Gisin, and VlhovÃ¡ was farther back in 13th. From only 28 starters 22 qualified for the second run and, as in the technical events, they started in reverse order which meant that VlhovÃ¡, starting 10th, was the first of the favorites to compete. She had a good run, which would be the second fastest run time, but at the end finished outside the medals in fifth. The fastest run time was set by Holdener and she took the lead until Shiffrin bettered her overall time. With three skiers to go Gisin took advantage of her comfortable lead and easily topped the results. Mowinckel was not able to threaten the top three and placed fourth, while Vonn did not finish the slalom run.
Michelle Gisin became the first ever female Olympic champion in Alpine Combined for Switzerland and followed her sister Dominique, who won gold in downhill four years earlier, to win a second gold medal for the Gisin family. Rossignol, with Gisin, won their second gold at this Games, Shiffrin used Atomic, and Holdener skied Head.

This winter saw only one World Cup Super Combined, which was won by Marie-MichÃ¨le Gagnon in Austrian Zauchensee, but with a Super G instead of a downhill, which favors technical skiiers. As Vonn was unable to compete after tearing her right ACL twice in 2013 (the first time at the World Championships in Schladming), the only two big favorites left were Maze and HÃ¶fl-Riesch.
Skiing first in the downhill phase Italian Francesca Marsaglia set a time of 1:43.96 and held onto the lead until the seventh skier to start, Lotte Sejersted (NOR), produced a best time of 1:43.85. Lara Gut (SUI), arguably more of a downhill and Super G specialist, then produced a leading time of 1:43.15 to give herself a chance to medal. The only skier to better this time was Julia Mancuso (USA) who skied the course in 1:42.68. Defending champion, Maria HÃ¶fl-Riesch (GER), produced a time of 1:43.72 for fifth place and keep her chances of a medal open.
With the top 30 going in reverse order, Å Ã¡rka StrachovÃ¡ (CZE) was to produce the fastest slalom run of 50.10 seconds, but a 25th place in the downhill section meant she finished ninth overall. Michaela Kirchgasser (AUT), more of a slalom specialist, produced the second quickest slalom for a combined time of 2:36.41, and led as several skiers came in behind her â eventually she would finish seventh. Ragnhild Mowinckel (NOR) and Dominique Gisin (SUI) briefly held the overall lead, until Austrian Nicole Hosp produced a fine run to give her an overall time of 2:35.02. She held onto the lead until HÃ¶fl-Riesch produced the third fastest slalom, to take the overall lead with 2:34.62. Gut tried to put in a performance, but was unable to finish the course, so leaving Mancuso the last of the medal contenders. Although only 13th fastest in the slalom, this was enough to give her a combined time of 2:35.15 for the bronze medal.
The first six finishers represented six different nations. As the day before in the men downhill, ski manufacturer Head won gold (HÃ¶fl-Riesch) and bronze (Mancuso), while Hosp earned silver with Fischer. HÃ¶fl-Riesch defended her title and followed in the footsteps of Janica KosteliÄ who won this event in 2002 and 2006. In total HÃ¶fl-Riesch became the sixth Alpine skier (and fourth women) to defend a gold medal.

In the slalom element, Shiffrin started as fifth but was again not able to finish the race as in the giant slalom and slalom days before, so she did not finish in her three best events.
It was Brignone who took over from the then leader LedeckÃ¡, but Holdener was 1.10 seconds faster in her slalom run to become the new leader. Her compatriot Gisin started just behind her and was again more than a second faster in the slalom to achieve the best run time and go on to win gold. The second-best slalom time was set by Katharina Huber but her margin after the downhill was too much to make up and she was only able to finish fifth overall.
Gisin repeated her win from 2018 in this event to become the first Swiss Alpine skier (women or men) to do so. She became the fourth woman to win back-to-back titles in Alpine skiing at the Olympics after Katja Seizinger (downhill 1994 and 1998), Deborah Compagnoni (giant slalom 1994 and 1998), and Janica KosteliÄ (combined 2002 and 2006). The one-two finish for Switzerland was their first ever in this event and only their third in Olympic history. The last time this happened for them was in downhill 1984 with Michela Figini and Maria Walliser.
All three 2022 medallists had already won a medal here in Beijing earlier, and all three did it in different events with Gisin in Super G, Holdener in slalom, and Brignone in giant slalom. Manufacture Rossignol took gold and bronze and silver went to Head.

The event was rescheduled for Thursday, 18 February and the only training run was held on Monday, 15 February. According to the rules the length was shortened and the start was from a lower point than the special downhill race held on the day before. But there were also some other changes on the piste after the bad crashes in the downhill.
This event was the first ever super combined held at the Olympics, so only one slalom heat was raced. Only two super combined events were held in the winter before the Olympics. The favorites were the close friends Lindsey Vonn and Maria Riesch. Riesch won the only World Cup super combined held on this course on 23 February 2008, but that event had a Super G instead of a downhill. Vonn led the Combined World Cup in 2009-10 and finished second in the Combined World Cup 2008-09, but failed to medal in the 2009 World Championships when she crashed in the slalom after winning the downhill heat. Riesch had the disadvantage that she didnât compete well the day before, while Julia Mancuso showed good form in Vancouver. The reigning world champion was Kathrin Zettel, who won gold at Val dâIsÃ¨re in 2009. Surprisingly Anja PÃ¤rson was able to start after her horrible crash the day before in the downhill. PÃ¤rson was the bronze medalist from Torino, 2007 World Champion, winner of the Combined World Cup in 2008-09, and was second in the 2009-10 Combined World Cup standings after winning the combined event at St. Moritz. She elected to compete at the last minute, but nobody expected her to medal.
The downhill started at 9:30 AM, with cold sunny weather. Julia Mancuso with was the first of the favorites and set the first top time. Lindsey Vonn started with number 18. She lost 0.23 seconds at the first intermediate split, but topped all other times and finished first, 0.8 seconds in front of Mancuso. After Vonn, Riesch started with number 19 and at the beginning it looked like that she was again struggling. But she found her speed at the end of the race and finally placed second only 33 hundredths of a second behind Vonn. Also PÃ¤rson finished the race in a top 10 position when placed seventh, 1.41 seconds behind Vonn. The slalom started at 12:30 PM. PÃ¤rson, seventh after the downhill, managed to take the lead. The sensational PÃ¤rson was still in the lead when the three leaders started. Mancuso, having won silver in the downhill the day before, raced a fine slalom and took the lead, 0.11 hundredths of a second in front of PÃ¤rson. But Riesch skied a great slalom and bettered Mancuso by 0.94 seconds. Then the top favorite and leader after the downhill, Lindey Vonn started. At the second intermediate split Vonn was only in second place, 0.18 seconds behind Riesch, but then hooked a gate and lost her right ski. So Riesch (on Head), after her disappointing downhill, won gold, Mancuso using Rossignol again won a silver medal, and the phenomenal PÃ¤rson (also on Head) took bronze, while Zettel (Atomic) and Maze (StÃ¶ckli) placed next to the podium. The first eight finishers represented eight different countries.

The 2001 World Cup champion was Croatian Janica KosteliÄ, who had overcome significant knee problems to get to that level. During a training run in December 1999, she had sustained a multi-ligament knee injury and the resultant surgery kept her out until the 2000 season. After winning the World Cup, she had undergone a series of knee surgeries in the summer of 2001, and was still recovering as she came into Salt Lake City. Better in the slalom than the downhill, the weather delay helped her as she was able to take the lead by placing first in the slalom, ahead of Martina Ertl, the 2001 World Champion. The downhill was won by Austrian Renate GÃ¶tschl, who had been fourth in the slalom. It moved her up to second place, but KosteliÄ placed third in the downhill, to hold onto her lead and take the gold medal. It was her first ever Olympic gold medal, but during the 2002 Winter Olympics, she would win three golds and four medals. Her four Alpine gold medals at one Olympics was a record for any alpine skier of either gender.

Originally, the winners of the heats, and the runner-up in heat three, which had four entrants, were to advance to the final. But the losers in heats two and three had posted faster times than the winners of heat one, so the officials attempted to conduct another qualifying heat, but they were unable to notify all the contestants.
It was elected to let the heat winners and the three fastest losing boats compete in the final, giving a six-boat final. However, the course only was laid out for four boats, so the heat winners protested and refused to compete. The first final was held among the runner-up in heat two, and the second- and third-place finishers in heat three. This seemed unsatisfactory so a second final was contested among the heat winners. The winner of this final, Cercle de lâAviron Roubaix, was invited to compete in the second final, but refused to do so. Both finals are usually considered to be Olympic championships.
There has been confusion over the identity(ies) of the coxswain for RC Favorite Hammonia.

The race for the bronze was close, as two-time Under-23 world champion Nino Schurter of Switzerland just edged his teammate Christoph Sauser by two seconds. Absalon gold made it three straight for France in this event as Miguel Martinez had won in 2000. One interesting competitor was Belgium Sven Nys. Nys was a multiple World Champion in cyclo-cross, which is a winter sport combining some elements of mountain biking with running cross-country over obstacles. Nys had difficulty with the heat in Beijing and placed ninth.

He would win four consecutive World Championships (2004-07) and defended his gold medal at the Beijing Olympics. The defending World Champion and 2000 silver medallist was Belgium Filip Meirhaeghe. But in July 2004, he was caught using EPO, and suspended for two years.  He admitted to doping, stating that he wanted to become an Olympic champion badly.

The reigning World Champion, however, was France Jordan Sarrou. Mathieu van der Poel of the Netherlands had been the European Champion from 2017 through 2019, while the most recent European Champion, Belgium Eli Iserbyt, was not in Tokyo. Van der Poel was an interesting entry, as he was best known for his dominance in cyclo-cross, having won the last three editions of the World Championships (2019-2021), as well as the 2015 title, and had additional successes on the road, yet he elected to concentrate on mountain biking for the Olympics. Also in contention was Mathias FlÃ¼ckiger of Switzerland, the most recent World runner-up. The qualification for the event was completed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and thus was not impacted by the delay of the Tokyo Games.
Van der Poel fell early in the race, eliminating him from contention, which allowed outside favorite Tom Pidcock of Great Britain to take control of the race. Pidcock was better known for his success in cyclo-cross, and had sustained a fractured collarbone after being hit by a car earlier in the year, but, after following the two Swiss favorites for a brief period, he launched an early attack and, by lap four, was comfortably in the lead. By the final lap, the first two podium spots had already been decided, with Pidcock finishing 20 seconds ahead of FlÃ¼ckiger.
The thrilling conclusion, therefore, was in the race for bronze, with Schurter attempting to hold on against New Zealand Anton Cooper, France Victor Koretzky, and Spain David Valero. In the end, Valero finished comfortably ahead of Schurter, who had to settle for fourth place, and the rest of the pack. A 2016 Olympian, Valero had few notable results prior to Tokyo and was somewhat of a surprise as bronze medallist.

Meanwhile at London 2012 at Hadleigh Farms, the course was enjoyed by the riders and was very spectator friendly (rated at 60% visibility). The South African course designer for the Rio 2016 Olympic Games mountain bike course, Nick Floros, created a technically challenging course for the riders, yet one that allowed the spectators to enjoy the competition as much as possible, with an 85% visibility, all while making use of the natural landscape at the Deodoro venue.
The Mountain Bike Centre in Rio was one of three venues that comprised the X-Park (along with canoe slalom and BMX), and was built with legacy in mind, remaining open to the public following the Olympics. The mountain bike course consisted of grassy wide-open stretches combined with man-made obstacles and serious slopes - a marked difference from the more level terrain four years before in London 2012.
The mountain bike races were mass start events on 20 (women) and 21 (men) August 2016. Riders were seeded into a starting grid according to their current Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) ranking. The riders completed one 0.57 km start loop, followed by six laps of the course for women (29.67 km) and seven laps for the men (34.52 km), where each lap was 4.85 km long. The total number of laps to be raced was announced at the team managersâ meeting on the day before the first race with the aim to ensure that the winning time was within the set parameters.
With the same rules and competition format, the only differences between the World Championships and the Olympic Games is that there are more competitors in the field at World Championships, due to different quotas for each National Olympic Committee (NOC): at the Olympic Games there are a maximum of three men and two women per NOC. There were no rule and competition format changes since the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
The men mountain bike race at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio started at 12:30 pm on 21 August 2016 and consisted of 49 riders from 32 nations. It was 23 degrees Celsius. As aforementioned, the race configuration consisted of one start loop of 0.57 km plus seven laps of the course for a total of 34.52 km. 2015 World road champion, Slovakia Peter Sagan put in a notable opening lap, moving from the back of the field into the lead group by the end of the first lap, but a flat tire at the beginning of the second lap ended his Olympic medal dream. It was then Switzerland Nino Schurter who took the early lead with Spaniard Carlos Coloma, but defending Olympic champion Jaroslav KulhavÃ½ of Czech Republic soon joined them as Coloma lost pace. The two-time Olympic champion (and five-time World champion), France Julien Absalon faded to two minutes back as the leaders set a scorching pace.
Starting the fifth of the seven lap race, Schurter and KulhavÃ½ had 30 seconds lead on the two-man chase of Coloma and Maxime Marotte of France, while Switzerland Mathias Fluckiger was chasing in fifth, more than a minute behind. The lead duo held an initial gap of more than 30 seconds over the first group behind them, who by this time appeared to be racing for bronze.
Schurter dropped KulhavÃ½ as they approached a technical rock section, opening a gap that he would hold until the finish. The Swiss rider started the final lap with a 33-second gap over KulhavÃ½, while Marotte and Coloma were 1:19 behind. Schurter continued to open his gap over the final lap, holding a 44-second lead on KulhavÃ½ with half a lap to go until the finish, and 1:50 over Coloma and Marotte.
Schurter won the gold 50 seconds ahead of KulhavÃ½, who won the silver. It was Coloma in for the bronze medal, 10 seconds ahead of Marotte in fourth. The two-time Olympic champion Absalon finished eighth. The medals were presented by Denis Oswald, IOC member (Switzerland) and Brian Cookson, President of the UCI Management Committee.

At the 2011 World Championships, however, Absalon was outperformed by Jaroslav KulhavÃ½ of the Czech Republic and Nino Schurter of Switzerland, who took gold and silver respectively in the tournament. KulhavÃ½ had been the 2011 overall World Cup leader and had placed 18th at the 2008 Summer Olympics, while Schurter, who won bronze at the 2008 Games, had been the 2009 World Champion and the 2010 and 2012 overall World Cup leader. These three men had held eight of the last nine World Cup podium spots between them (Burry Stander of South Africa had been runner-up in 2012, knocking Absalon out of the medals) and looked to be the favorites at the 2012 Summer Games.
As in the women event, where Catharine Pendrel of Canada finished ninth, men Olympic mountain biking was not to be dominated by race favorite. Although Absalon and Schurter had a great start and led the pack for the first several minutes, Absalon suffered a puncture in the opening lap and abandoned the course. This left room for Schurter, KulhavÃ½, and Italian Marco Fontana, who had been fifth in Beijing, to form a lead group that began to drift from the rest of the cyclists, although they were soon joined by JosÃ© Antonio Hermida of Spain, the 2004 Olympic silver medalist and 2010 World Champion. By the third lap Burry Stander of South Africa, fifteenth at the 2008 Games, caught up to the main group with an impressive charge after a poor start that left him in 11th place early in the race. These five men led the field for the remainder of the event, and it soon became clear among them who would be battling for the gold medal. Although at some point over the course each of these five riders made a charge for first place, and all were leading at some point, Hermida and Stander began to fade in the second half of the race, with Hermida having difficulty maintaining the pace and Stander seemingly exhausted from his initial charge to the lead group. Stander would attempt several more charges throughout the race, but fell back soon after each push, leaving Schurter, KulhavÃ½, and Fontana to compete for the medals.
In the final lap Fontana struggled to keep pace and eventually dropped far enough back that he was nearly overtaken by Hermida for the bronze medal. Schurter and KulhavÃ½ never waned, however, and, unlike the women race that had been decided long before the finish line, the men event came down to a sprint between these two riders. In the end it was KulhavÃ½ who earned the gold medal, edging out Schurter by one second, who was forced to settle for silver. Fontana managed to stave off Hermida challenge, claiming bronze by a margin of four seconds, while Stander finished one second after Hermida, but still half a minute faster than the next rider. For Hermida it was his second fourth-place finish at the Olympics, following his performance at the 2000 Games (he had been tenth in Beijing).

Since the 1996 Olympics, the four world titles had been won by four different cyclists, with the 2000 title going to France Miguel Martinez. The 1996 silver medalist, Thomas Frischknecht (SUI), tried to steal the race early and led after the first four laps but he was then passed by Martinez and Belgium Filip Meirhaeghe. Martinez quickly broke Meirhaeghe and won the gold medal by over a minute.
Martinez had not only won the 2000 World title, but also the World Cup, hence dominating the season. His father was Mariano Martinez, who won two stages (1978, 1980) and the polka dot jersey (1978) in the Tour de France. In July 2004, Meirhaeghe was caught using EPO, and was suspended for two years.  He admitted to doping, but was able to make a comeback and compete at the 2008 Olympics. Frischknecht was a veteran, having been runner up at the Worlds in 1990-92. He again finished second in 1996, but moved into first when the winner was later disqualified for doping.  He was also a former World Championship runner-up in cyclo-cross, as his father had been.
In 22nd place was Michael Rasmussen (DEN), the 1999 World Champion. Rasmussen would soon turn to road racing, and won the polka dot jersey as King of the Mountains at the 2005-2006 Tour de France. In 2005, he was in third place in GC entering the penultimate stage, an individual time trial. But obviously not a time trialist, he fell several times, endured several bike changes, placed 77th in the stage, and dropped to seventh overall. In 2007, Rasmussen again put on the polka dot jersey, and actually held the yellow jersey as leader of the Tour after 16 stages and seemed assured of victory. But he was then withdrawn by his Rabobank team when he was found to have evaded doping controls several times, by frequently failing to report his location. A future two-time runner-up in the Tour de France also in this race was Australian Cadel Evans, who placed seventh, but later turned to road racing.

After having finished fourth at the 2008 Summer Games, missing out on bronze by nine seconds, she improved significantly and went on to win the 2010 World Cup and the 2011 World Championships. Going into the London Olympics ranked #1, she won the test event on the course, sealing her reputation as the favorite. In a sport as unpredictable as mountain biking, however, she would certainly not go unchallenged. Sabine Spitz of Germany, the defending Olympic champion and World Champion in 2003, was forty years old but had not slowed down and was well-prepared to defend her Olympic title. Poland Maja WÅoszczowska, the 2010 World Champion and a silver medalist at both the 2008 Summer Olympics and the 2011 World Championships, was not competing due to injury but Beijing Olympic bronze medalist and two-time World Champion Irina Kalentyeva of Russia was expected to mount a challenge to Pendrel as well. Finally there was hometown favorite Annie Last who, although never finishing better than eighth at a major international competition, had spent two years training as a senior rather than in the under-23 division in the hopes of being selected for the 2012 Summer Olympics. With the support of the sold-out, 20,000 strong crowd at the event, she could certainly not be counted out.
After the start Pendrel, Last, and Spitz helped form a four rider-strong lead group that included Julie Bresset of France, the most recent under-23 World Champion. These cyclists put some distance between themselves and the field behind in the beginning, but Pendrel and Last began to fade by the second lap and were eventually passed by American Georgia Gould, who came from around 16th position to 7th by the end of the first lap. Following a collision between Pendrel and Last, Bresset, Spitz, and Gould led the field and were never challenged. Bresset was usually in front of the trio, with Spitz and Gould exchanging podium positions until Spitz crashed on a technical section approximately halfway through the race, which forced Gould to stop. Bresset used the opportunity to break away and was all but assured the gold medal, which she claimed over a minute ahead of anyone else. Spitz and Gould were still far ahead of their closest competitors and, while Gould early charge from 16th to podium position eventually cost her energy, Spitz was able to use her experience to outmanoeuver her opponent and win silver a comfortable six seconds ahead of her American rival. Gould finished with the bronze medal, a respectable 33 seconds ahead of Kalentieva, who was fourth. Last and Pendrel faded to eighth and ninth respectively, certainly a disappointing finish for the overwhelming favorite in the race. Pendrel would, however, go on to win bronze in the event at the 2016 Summer Olympics.

Pezzo opened a big lead, which Sydor closed slightly near the end, but Pezzo won gold by over a minute. The biggest story of the race, however, was likely Pezzo cleavage. An attractive woman, she raced on a day of sweltering heat, and to combat that, had her jersey unzipped almost to her navel. The Italian press discussed this fact almost as much as her cycling abilities. She would again win the World Championship in 1997.

Four seconds back from the lead pack was Norway Gunn Rita Dahle-FlesjÃ¥, followed by World bronze medallist Canadian Emily Batty and Czech KateÅina Nash, the winter/summer Olympian, who were just over 23 seconds back.
On the second lap, Indergand relinquished her lead to the chasers, with Rissveds, Neff and WÅoszczowska forming a new lead threesome that took charge going into the second half of the race. Soon Rissveds led the lead group to start lap four, holding a three second advantage over Neff, and four seconds over WÅoszczowska. Neff eventually paid for her efforts to keep up with Rissveds, losing contact with the Swedish rider and WÅoszczowska.
Going into the penultimate lap, WÅoszczowska led Rissveds through the start/finish, with Neff falling further off the lead pace, and a trio made of up Canadians Catharine Pendrel and Emily Batty, along with Nash chasing, nearly a minute later.

On the fourth lap, defending champion Paola Pezzo (ITA) passed Blatter and challenged Fullana for the lead. On a tight downhill section Pezzo and Fullana collided, and Fullana crashed. Pezzo managed to stay upright and powered away to her second gold medal. Fullana accused Pezzo of intentionally colliding, as this had happened before at the 1999 Europeans. Pezzo had declared this to be her last mountainbike race, but also competed in Athens. Her preparation for the Olympics had been remarkable, training alone on a track similar to the Olympic course, purposely built near her home.

The three Swiss riders soon pulled ahead of all other competitors and captured all three medals by a comfortable margin.
This was Switzerland first podium sweep since the 1936 Berlin Games, when they captured all of the medals in the floor exercise, although in that case bronze was shared by a German competitor. Switzerland only other clean sweep had come in 1924, in the pommeled horse, when the nation had taken the top four spots. As for cycling sweeps, this had only occurred previously at the 1904 St. Louis Olympics, in many of the odd, US-dominated races, and the 1906 Intercalated Games, when France captured the podium in the road race.

The event was put on the program in an attempt to have the throwers imitate the classic poses seen by discus throwers on ancient Greek amphora.  Unfortunately, almost nobody understood exactly what poses they were required to make during their throw.  The rules read as follows:
a)  For this test a pedestal 80 centimetres long and 70 centimetres broad is inclined, with a maximum height of 15 centimetres behind and a minimum height of 5 centimetres in front.
   b)  The Hellenic method of throwing the discus is something like the following:
The thrower places himself on the pedestal with the feet apart, and holding the discus in either hand. He then takes it with both hands slightly stretched, lifting them without letting go the discus, and stretching out the rest of his body in the same way in the same direction.  After that he turns the trunk slightly to the right and bends sharply, so as to bring the left hand when free to the right knee, and the right hand still holding the discus, as far back as the build of the shoulder permits.  At this moment, the right foot should be forward and the legs bent; the right foot rests on the sole, and the left on the toes only.  Then by a sharp and simultaneous extension of the whole body, the thrower throws the discus straight in front of him.
The Greek judges ended up being a bit lenient and Verner JÃ¤rvinen won the event over Nikolaos Georgantas.  This rather upset Georgantas, who did not think JÃ¤rvinen style was legal.  After the decision was announced, the Greek walked over to the pedestal and let fly in an unhampered manner, far outdistancing all other throws.  Matin Sheridan was probably hampered by his efforts to compete concurrently in the standing high jump.

The world record listed in the program was that for the freestyle event (128-10 [39.29]), rather than the 115-4 (35.16) world record for the Greek-style event, which had been set by Verner JÃ¤rvinen (FIN) at the 1906 Olympics.

This was won by Sheridan by 7-31/2 (2.23 m), throwing 127-101/4 (38.97) to Rose 120-6Â¾ (36.74).
Martin Sheridan was an Irish immigrant who was inspired to take up athletics by his brother Richard, who won the discus throw at the 1902 AAU championships.  Sheridan eventually became one of the great athletes of his time, setting several world discus records, winning nine Olympic medals (five gold), and three times winning the AAU title in the all-around championship.
For over 100 years, the result of this event has always been considered to be 1) Sheridan, 2) Rose. In 2015 Swedish researcher Tomas Magnusson discovered some 1905 US newspapers discussing the fact that Sheridan may have been disqualified. In August 1904 he competed at the Metropolitan AAU and his amateur status was questioned by officials Charles Sherrill and Matthew Halpin, based on the fact that he was the trackmaster at the Pelham Bay Park Athletic Grounds. The articles state that Sheridan was disqualified from his Olympic performances and Rose would become the winner of the discus throw. However, in future Spalding annuals, and all other records of Olympic results through the 1910s, Sheridan continued to be listed as the winner of this event. In addition, later stories about Sheridan note that he was âinvestigated and cleared by the AAU.â The IOC presumably never took any action on this problem.

Born in Bohola, County Mayo, Ireland, Martin Sheridan emigrated to the United States in 1900, following his brother, Richard, who had come over in 1897.  Richard Sheridan quickly established himself in the United States as a discus thrower.  Martin Sheridan also took up the event and quickly became the best in the world at it.  Sheridan stood 6â3) and weighed 195 lbs. in his prime.
In the era when Sheridan competed, there was no official governing body that recognized world records.  Various sources credit him with between seven and sixteen world records.  Sheridan Olympic fame rests primarily on winning the Olympic gold medal in the discus in 1904, 1906, and 1908.  But he was far more than just a discus thrower.  Overall, he won nine Olympic medals, including five gold, counting those Sheridan won in the 1906 Olympics.
Sheridan was a superb jumper and weight thrower, but he displayed his other talents in the all-around championship, the early American forerunner of the decathlon.  Sheridan entered three all-arounds in his athletic career, the AAU National Championships of 1905, 1907, and 1909.  He won each of them easily, and set a world record each time, finally leaving it at 7,385 points, a mark which Jim Thorpe broke by only a few points in 1912.  Sheridan also won the AAU discus championship in 1904, 1906, 1907, and again in 1911, just before his retirement as an athlete.
Off the field, Sheridan worked as a policeman (1902-1918) as did many of the Irish-American athletes.  His fame led him to be the personal bodyguard for the governor of New York whenever he visited the city.  Sheridan never married and died without issue from pneumonia only seven years after he retired from athletics.  In the New York Herald-Tribune, his obituary proclaimed him to be the greatest all-around athlete ever known in the United States - greater even than Jim Thorpe.  Thorpe himself stated in the obituary, âSheridan was the greatest athlete in the world.  He could do things I never could.â

But after winning the AAU title in 1911, he retired, leaving the 1912 Olympic discus throw wide-open.
There were several challengers for Sheridan crown.  On 5 August 1911, Finland Elmer Niklander broke Sheridan world record with a throw of 44.01.

Year rankings had been dominated by the Soviet women, but in 1948 the USSR still refused to compete at the Olympics, albeit for the last time. This prevented Nina Dumbadze, European Champion and unofficial World Record holder with a 50-metre-throw, from competing. A week after the Olympic final, she would shatter the World Record officially by nearly 5 metres. By contrast, the 41.92 (137-61/2) winning throw by Micheline Ostermeyer seems like a mediocre performance. But considering that Ostermeyer had only entered the event because she was so versatile, and had already qualified for two other events, it can be considered remarkable. The Frenchwoman was also a great concert pianist, which was much harder for her than sports: )I practise five hours a day on the piano, and five hours a week for athletics), she once noted.

Finally, in 1948 Dumbadze set an IAAF-ratified world record but the Soviet Union did not compete at the 1948 Olympics.

The big question of the 2002 Olympic luge doubles concerned whether the home track advantage of the American pairs would be enough to topple the Europeans and earn a first US Olympic gold in the sport. The answer was to be no but the margin of victory for the German pair of Alexander Resch and Patric Leitner was small.
Resch and Leitner, the 2004 world champions, set the best time of the first run with Clay Ives and Chris Thorpe leading US teammates, the Mark Grimmette / Brian Martin combination, for second and third. The Americans were both faster than the German leaders over the final run but not by enough to overhaul them for the gold medal. Grimmette and Martin were fast enough to put themselves ahead of their compatriots and into the silver medal position.

Aided by Italian team trainer Hans Senger, Sailer was able to fix his boot in time to start. Going off as the 14th starter, the leader at the time was Germany Hans Peter Lanig, but Sailer bested his time by 7.6 seconds. It led to an easy victory for him as only three skiers came within five seconds of his time, with Switzerland Raymond Fellay second and Sailer teammate, Anderl Molterer, third. Acclaimed the greatest Alpine skier ever, Sailer succeeded Stein Eriksen as the sport superstar.

The Austrians chose four skiers with Leonhard Stock picked as an alternate. But his training performances were better than all the other skiers so he was moved up to start in the downhill, dropping Sepp Walcher, the 1978 World Champion, from the start. Stock started ninth, with the lead at that time held by Italy Herbert Plank, but Stock bettered his time by 1.63 seconds to take the lead. And it held up, giving him a very surprising gold medal.

The Dave Murray Downhill, a difficult and fast course with 37 corners, several steeps, flats, drop-offs, compressions and long turns, like âCoaches Cornerâ, was prepared perfectly. Due to poor weather the first training run on 10 February was halted after 42 racers. The second training run one day later on 11 February was the only practice run for all competitors and saw Austrian Michael Walchhofer leading. To save the course the last training run on 12 February was cancelled. Originally the race start was scheduled for Saturday, 13 February at 12 noon, but the race was delayed very early in the morning due to snow in the higher part of the track and due to rain and fog in the lower part. Eventually warm temperatures forced a postponement until Monday, 15 February at 10:30.
The favorites for the race were the current World Cup leader in downhill, winner of two World Cup downhills in the season and fastest in the first training run Didier Cuche, the Austrian Michael Walchhofer (Downhill World Cup winner in 2008-09), and the locals Manuel Osborne-Paradis, Robbie Dixon (placed second in both trainings), and Erik Guay. Cuche broke his right thumb after a fall in the last World Cup race before the Olympics, but recovered right before the Games. The Canadians had the advantage that there were no Pre-Olympics so they had had the possibility to practice exclusively for two years since the course was modified. The last World Cup downhill race on the course, before the slight changes, was held on 25 February 1995. Only one of the downhillers came back 15 years later to compete at the Olympics, Patrik JÃ¤rbyn who placed 50th in 1995. The next three tries to hold a downhill race were all cancelled due to weather issues (1996-98). Both the gold medalist from 2006 Antoine DÃ©nÃ©riaz, as well as the bronze medalist Bruno Kernen, retired in 2007 and the very best downhiller of the last decade, Austrian Hermann Maier, retired just before the 2009-10 season. Also unable to compete was the reigning world champion, Canada John Kucera, who broke his right tibia in the World Cup Super G race at Lake Louise in November.
On race day the weather was cloudy and the temperature was about 0Â°, with one cold night enough to make the course hard, rough, and icy, so the race could be started. The FIS official, assistant referee, and former Olympic competitor Helmuth Schmalzl was the course setter. The first top time was set by the French David Poisson who came up with starting number 3 and a very close and thrilling race began. The first of the top favorites was Bode Miller with bib number 8. He topped the times of Poisson, leading by 0.97 seconds at the second intermediate mark at around 50 seconds of the run after the )Toilet Bowl). At the finish line Miller took the lead by 0.42 seconds. The first of the top group was Norwegian Aksel Lund Svindal with bib number 16, who lost time in the first part of the course and after the )Toilet Bowl) was 0.79 seconds behind Miller. But an excellent race in the middle section and final sections enabled Svindal to overtake Miller by only 0.02 seconds. Didier DÃ©fago started a few racers later. He equaled the top time of Miller at the first intermediate mark and raced a next to perfect downhill from the beginning to the end. At the last intermediate he was 0.03 seconds in front of Svindal and at the finish DÃ©fago took the lead by 0.07 seconds. The next favorite to start was Didier Cuche in position 22. Cuche also topped the times of DÃ©fago at the first two intervals, but lost time in the middle section, and would eventually finish sixth, leaving the medals to DÃ©fago, Svindal, and Miller in that order. DÃ©fago who won at KitzbÃ¼hel and Wengen last season, was a surprise winner, but not overly so, although he only qualified for the Swiss team at the last minute, when he bumped out Tobias GrÃ¼nenfelder and Patrick KÃ¼ng in the last training run to qualify as the fourth Swiss competitor.
The first five finishers represented five different countries and skied on three different products. DÃ©fago won with Rossignol; Svindal, Mario Scheiber, and Guay used Atomic; while Miller trusted Head. Twenty-two years after Pirmin Zurbriggen won in Calgary, Switzerland again won downhill gold in Canada. As a tribute to this win the Swiss racing suits were designed in the same style as in 1988, so DÃ©fago won the race in the same red and white outfit that Zurbriggen wore. The first major alpine skiing decision at the 2010 Winter Olympics ended with good luck. A course worker struggled and fell on the left side of the finishing straight. He was not able to leave the piste before the Australian Craig Branch came down with maximum speed. Luckily Branch had chosen to ride on the right side.

His victory was derided by the European skiers, who claimed he only won because the course was easy, to which Johnson asked, âIf it was so easy, why didnât they win it?â Johnson was a cocky, controversial character who had a very short period in the skiing limelight.

It was not the first race at this Games, as the first run of the women giant slalom had already been held, but the men downhill was held before the second run.
The downhill piste, named âRockâ, was again created by Bernhard Russi, this time assisted by Didier DÃ©fago, and Russi called the slope comparable to the Birds of Prey in Beaver Creek. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there were no races on the piste before Beijing, as the World Cup events planned for February 2020 had to be cancelled. Therefore, the slope was brand new for all racers and only two training runs could be held as the third one was cancelled due to strong winds.
The downhill World Cup since the last Olympics in South Korea had been dominated by Beat Feuz, who had won all four downhill Crystal Globes since then (2018-2021). The last two World champions, however, were Kjetil Jansrud (2019 in Ãre) and Vincent Kriechmayr (2021 in Cortina dâAmpezzo).
The ongoing World Cup of the current season saw eight downhills held with six different winners and only Aleksander Aamodt Kilde was able to win more than one race with wins in Beaver Creek, Wengen 1, and KitzbÃ¼hel 1. The other races were won by Matthias Mayer (Lake Louise), Bryce Bennett (Val Gardena), Dominik Paris (Bormio), Vincent Kriechmayr (Wengen 2), and Beat Feuz (KitzbÃ¼hel 2). The results put Kilde at the top of the standings, followed by Feuz, Mayer, and Odermatt (who finished second in three races).
Of the medallists from PyeongChang, the Norwegians Aksel Lund Svindal (gold) had retired in February 2019 and Kjetil Jansrud (silver) did not start after still recovering from an injury following a fall in early December 2021. This led to only Feuz (bronze) participating in the Beijing race. The first training run was won by Stefan Rogentin, but Kilde set the best time by winning the second training run with 1:43.72.
The race started with only 42 competitors, the fewest ever for this event, and was held in good conditions with the wind not being a factor on race day. Kriechmayr with bib number 1 set the early pace but was overtaken by his compatriot Mayer, with Kilde placing between them and the surprising Jack Crawford, only seven-hundredths of a second behind Mayer. Feuz started with bib number 13 and put in a great performance, and took the lead by 16/100ths. Paris and Odermatt were not able to get into a podium position and the last racer of the top group was French veteran Johan Clarey. He finished second, just 1/10th behind Feuz, knocking Crawford off the podium, who finally finished fourth.
Feuz won the race with an average speed of 110.50 km/h and 3.07 metres ahead of Clarey. The first four finishers all used Head skis while Kilde in fifth place raced Atomic. Clarey, already the second oldest male Olympic Alpine skier to participate in Beijing, became the oldest Alpine skiing medallist ever at 41-030.

As at Sochi in 2014 the run was designed by 1972 Olympic downhill gold medalist Bernhard Russi. He made a course with a lot of jumps, including four big jumps, and the racers felt that it could not be compared with tracks in Europe or North America.
Seven out of nine events of the undergoing downhill World Cup were already held and the standings saw Beat Feuz, who won races in Lake Louise, Wengen, and Garmisch, in the lead; followed by Aksel Lund Svindal, winner in Beaver Creek and Val Gardena; Dominik Paris, winner in Bormio; and Thomas DreÃen, winner in KitzbÃ¼hel.

Feuz was also the 2017 World Champion, following his compatriot Patrick KÃ¼ng, who won in 2015. The pre-Olympic downhill race held in February 2016 was won by Jansrud.
The starting order for speed events was changed since the last Olympics. The top 10 racers of the World Cup Starting List (WCSL), beginning with the leader, could choose an odd bib number from 1-19, while the next ten racers from the WCSL could choose an even bib number from 2-20. The run changed in the days after the delay, becoming faster and the jumps were wider, and the race was decided from the second big jump to the end. Wind was still a factor, but at the end the top six of the WCSL finished in the top six.
Svindal won gold for Norway, which was the last men Olympic Alpine skiing gold missing for that country. He also became the first man to win both speed events at the Olympics after his Super G gold medal from Vancouver in 2010 and he became the oldest Olympic Alpine skiing champion ever, at 35-051. Together with Jansrud in second place it was the first gold-silver double for a nation in downhill since Pirmin Zurbriggen and Peter MÃ¼ller finished 1-2 for Switzerland at Calgary in 1988. Svindal won this race with an average speed of 106.47 km/h and was 3.54 metres ahead of Jansrud at the finish line. Both Norwegians and the Swiss Feuz raced skis from Head giving it a sweep.

After a test event had been held there the skiers felt that it was too short for a championship downhill. They requested that the start be moved higher up the mountain, but the Japanese organizers demurred, stating that this would take the course into an environmentally protected region. The FÃ©dÃ©ration Internationale de Ski (FIS) countered that many recreational skiers used that area and could not understand why the Olympic skiers could not race there as well. Eventually a compromise was reached with the course lengthened slightly. In fact, at a length of 3,289 metres, it became the longest men downhill in Olympic history.
However, starting the 1998 Olympic downhill was anything but easy, as the event, traditionally the first Alpine event at the Olympics, had to be postponed three times because of weather. It did not start until five days after it was scheduled. Though the course was not felt to be difficult, that failed to take into consideration the 7th turn, which caused 14 of the 15 non-finishers to fall or miss the turn, leading to their disqualification. France Jean-Luc CrÃ©tier was the third skier out of the starthouse, and posted the fastest time to that point. As contender after contender, including Austrian Hermann âThe Herminatorâ Maier, met their fate on the seventh turn, CrÃ©tier time held up for the gold medal.

The last racer who was able to come close to the medals was Lotte Sejersted (NOR), who was in third position at the last interval, and finally finished sixth.
Maze and Gisin won the race with an average speed of 96.16 km/hr and 2.67 metres ahead of Gut. A surprise of the event was the performance of 7th-placed Hungarian Edit MiklÃ³s from a nation with little tradition in skiing and having a best finish of 12th on the World Cup circuit. This was also the first ever top ten finish for a Hungarian Alpine skier at the Olympics. Seven different nations placed in the top nine with only Switzerland having three athletes in the top five. Five different skiing manufacturers placed in the top six with only StÃ¶ckli with two skiiers â Maze in first and Suter in fifth. Gisin won the sole medal at this Games for Dynastar, while Gut won bronze using Rossignol.

924553,"Downhill, Women",2010 Winter Olympics,57,Alpine Skiing,17 February 2010,"Whistler Creekside, Whistler (Franz's Downhill)",44 from 22 countries,na,IFR,"Franz Run was described as one of the most difficult women downhill pistes, a very fast and selective course with some interesting sections like âDeuceâ, âJokers Traversâ, and âFrog Bankâ. The first training run on Thursday, 11 February was stopped after only two starters when Stacey Cook crashed and was brought to hospital by helicopter, but luckily she was unhurt. The other scheduled training runs were cancelled, but a downhill race needs at least one practice run, so a training session was held on Monday, 15 February, before and after the men race. The men Dave Murray Downhill and Franz Run share the âHot Airâ section and the finish, so there was the curious situation that the training run was divided into two parts. The first part was finished right before the two pistes became one, and when the men race was ended the women started again this time from the slalom start and skied the last 20 seconds of their course. This meant that the racers did not hit racing speed at âHot Airâ, which became an important and dangerous fact during the race.
There were only two favorites considered â the close friends Lindsey Vonn and Maria Riesch. Vonn was fastest in the only training run, won the 2009 World Championship title as well as the Downhill World Cup in 2007-08 and 2008-09, and won five of the first six World Cup downhills during the 2009-10 season. Riesch won the last World Cup downhill race before the Olympics in St. Moritz and was also second in the Downhill World Cup. Vonn injured her shin while training only a week before the Olympics, but the postponement of the super combined event gave her time to recover. The gold medalist from Turin 2006 Michaela Dorfmeister retried shortly after those Games. The silver medalist Martina Schild was unable to compete due to injury. She suffered an anterior cruciate ligament tear after a fall while training for the last World Cup downhill before the Games. The only World Cup downhill race held on Franz Run on 22 February 2008 had been won by Nadia Styger.
The race started at 11 AM with perfect sunny weather and a frozen piste with hard, but bumpy snow. With the first starters it was shown that the course was very difficult and that it would be nearly impossible to run with no problems. The first notable time was set by Austrian Elisabeth GÃ¶rgl with bib number 5 when she topped the time of Stacey Cook by more than 1.3 seconds. Julia Mancuso in the 10th starting position bettered all of GÃ¶rgl splits and took the lead by 0.9 seconds. With bib number 11 Dominique Gisin crashed at the last jump, the âHot Airâ, and the race was held up for some time. Gisin sustained a concussion and after her fall a snow hill next to the finish line was dug out to increase safety. The first downhiller of the top group was Lindsey Vonn. She took the lead from the first intermediate split to the finish to take the lead. In start position #21, Sweden Anja PÃ¤rson did a great race when she placed in the top three at all intermediates, but near the finish PÃ¤rson was unable to manage a 60 metre jump, and crashed horrifically. She hit hard on her back and slid into the finish area, and the race was held up for a longer time. PÃ¤rson was able to walk away, but with contusions of her leg and back. Maria Riesch had to wait until PÃ¤rson was rescued and the piste was opened again. After watching multiple crashes, Riesch did not perform at her best and never contended for a medal, finishing eighth.
At the end the top favorite Vonn won gold with an average speed of 101.55 km/hr and was 0.56 seconds or 15.71 metres in front of Mancuso. Surprisingly GÃ¶rgl, shocked after the crash of PÃ¤rson, won bronze exactly 50 years after her mother Traudl Hecher also won bronze in the Olympic downhill at Squaw Valley. The first five finishers skied on four different products: Vonn and GÃ¶rgl used Head; Mancuso preferred Rossignol; while Andrea Fischbacher was on Atomic and Fabienne Suter on StÃ¶ckli.

Vonn set the best time in the first training run, while Venier did so in the second and Michelle Gisin, younger sister of Dominique, in the third.

If so, the maximum length of the Ã©pÃ©e blade was 34 inches (86 cm) and the maximum diameter of the guard was five inches (13 cm). Bouts were for three touches with each touch counting for one point. In cases where both fencers were touched simultaneously, one-quarter point was deducted from each contestant point score. The final placement of the fencers was determined not by the number of bout victories but rather by adding the total number of points earned by each fencer with the fencer having the greatest total declared the winner, the next greatest second, and so on. So, no touch counts or bout victories are shown in the results because they were not used to determine the promotion or placement.
Charles Tatham had won the US Championship in 1901-03 but the best American fencer in 1904 was likely Charles Bothner, US Champion that year with both foil and Ã©pÃ©e, but he did not compete at the 1904 Olympics. Results of the matches in this event are not known, but gold went to Cuban RamÃ³n Fonst, who had won the title at the 1900 Olympics in Paris, and also won the individual foil in St. Louis. Tatham came in for the silver medal, followed by Albertson Van Zo Post, who had been American champion with this weapon in 1896, and would win again in 1912. Fonst actually competed again at the 1924 Olympics, after an absence of 20 years, but won no medals.

Oddly enough the Italians did not overly impress during the preliminary rounds but only came to the fore during the final pool. All three Italians ended with 5-2 records although Giuseppe Delfino had an opportunity to win outright which was frustrated on the deciding hit by American Richard Pew.
The first barrage was inconclusive with each man winning and losing one bout apiece but at the second attempt Carlo Pavesi defeated both Giuseppe Delfino and Edoardo Mangiarotti to claim the Olympic title. Delfino then beat reigning champion Mangiarotti for the silver medal. All three men would return as part of the victorious Italian team in Rome with also adding the individual gold.

This would be a repeat of the 2011 World Championship final where teenager Sun Yujie had defeated her vastly more experienced teammate Li Na. Things did not go to plan although not perhaps in the wild, erratic manner of the men event. Li Na was despatched by Britta Heidemann in the round of 16 and when the dust settled only Sun of the top 10 seeds remained in contention at the semi-final stage.
The first semi-final saw a monumental upset when Yana Shemiakina fought a brilliant tactical fight to eliminate Sun Yujie but even this was overshadowed by the controversial finish to the other semi. Heidemann and Korea Sin A-Lam fought a low scoring, cagey bout which was tied at 5-all as time began to run out. What happened next is a source of great controversy and has never entirely been explained in its entirety. What appears to have happened is this; the two women score simultaneous hits which nullified each other score but brought the clock down to one second.
They quickly attacked again and once more scored simultaneously but the clock did not move.
In top level fencing the referee duties are separated from that of the timekeeper and the timekeeper presses a button to start the clock only after the call of âAllez!â from the referee.
If the timekeeper is slow in pressing the button the electronic system can register a hit in a fraction of a section.
At 0:01, Heidemann anticipates the call and begins her attack early, with another double hit as the result. There is only a tiny fraction of a second between the time starting when the timekeeper presses the button and stopping automatically when Heidemann point is depressed. As a result, the time still shows 0:01. The two restart and, amazingly, the same scenario occurs once more with a double hit and no time taken off the clock. What now seems to happen is that the timekeeper mistakenly restarts the clock and time runs out. Since the clock has been running without the two fencers in action it is obvious that an error has occurred so the referee orders the countdown clock to be reset to 0:01. Heidemann is again quick off the mark but this time she clearly scores a hit and seemingly earns her place in the final. As a distraught Sin begins sobbing the Korean coach quickly launches an appeal against the decision. After viewing television replays the decision is upheld but the Korean coach orders Sin to stay on the platform until a further appeal to the FIE is considered. Sin waits for an hour before being gently escorted away when the second appeal is also rejected
The written appeal read as follows (sic):
âDear DT Members, I canât agree the decision of the referee, because it rested 1 second and there were 3 times coup double and the time always rests 1 second and they fixed time because the
time passed and 1 second rest. German fencer attempt by fente and remise but one second rests still. It canât be possible during 1 second 4 actions. Who can believe this situation? I want fix this situation calculating time. Korean team cannot accept this situation.â
Sin would later face more heartbreak when she lost the bronze medal bout against Sun.
After the drama of the semi-finals the gold medal decider between Yana Shemiakina and Britta Heidemann could well have been an anti-climax. Indeed when the first period was ended prematurely by the referee because of the lack of combativity shown by the two finalists it seemed to be heading that way. Thankfully the action soon heated up with the score at the end of the final period tied with 8 points apiece. Heidemann played the aggressor in the extra time but, after two double hits, she missed with an attempted fleche and was wide open to a counter from the Ukrainian who took advantage to win gold.

He again won by ippon in the pool final, this time in 51 seconds over Hungarian Tibor Kincses. Rey came thru the other pool with no major difficulty but without the flair of RodrÃ­guez. The final was somewhat disappointing. Rey countered RodrÃ­guez attacking style and won with a koka via a kosoto-gari counter to win the gold medal.

Ties broken by lightest bodyweight.,na,"Zhou Jun, like most Chinese weightlifters at the 2012 Summer Olympics, was the favorite for the gold medal in her division, the women featherweight. As a 17 year-old rookie with no major international medals to her name, however, she was far from a lock and was expected to be challenged by several competitors including Zulfiya Chinshanlo of Kazakhstan, World Champion in 2009 and 2011, and  Cristina Iovu of Moldova, the reigning European Champion. Zhao most distinguished opponent, however, was possibly Aylin DaÅdelen of Turkey, four-time European Champion (2002, 2003, 2010, 2011) and thrice runner-up (2004, 2009, 2012), runner-up at the two most recent World Championships, and fourth-place finisher at the 2004 Games (although some of these feats, including her previous Olympic appearance, came in the lightweight category).
Zhao failed in her first three snatch attempts at 95 kg, further opening up the competition for the Olympic crown. The snatch competition went to Iovu with 99 kg, followed by Hsu Shu-Ching of Chinese Taipei, a bronze medalist at the most recent World Championships, with 96 kg, and Chinshanlo with 95 kg. Approaching the end of the event, Iovu moved into the gold medal position with a 120 kg lift in her second attempt, while Hsu failed at her first attempt of 123 kg, which would have tied their total lifts and placed Hsu in first by virtue of her lower body weight. Hsu was then successful in her final attempt, putting her in the gold medal position. DaÅdelen, who had been in a three-way tie for fourth with 91 kg, failed at her first attempt of 124 kg in the clean and jerk, but Chinshanlo, the world record holder in the clean and jerk with 130 kg, lifted 125 kg with ease to slide into first place. Iovu then attempted to lift 125 kg, which would have put her well into the lead, but failed and faced being knocked off the podium entirely with Chinshanlo already in the gold medal position and two lifts left from DaÅdelen.
DaÅdelen needed a 129 kg lift, three kilograms higher than the previous Olympic record set by 2008 champion Prapawadee Jaroenrattanatarakoon of Thailand, just to tie Chinshanlo, although the Turk higher body weight would still have relegated her to silver. The Turk failed at this weight on her second attempt, apparently injuring her elbow in the process, and did not appear for her third try, which eliminated her from the competition. Chinshanlo, already assured of the gold, set a world record with a 131 kg lift in her second lift, the first broken record of 2012 Olympics. Her third attempt, this time at 135 kg, failed, but this was irrelevant: Chinshanlo had distinguished herself not only as a world record holder, but as a true Olympic champion.
Controversy brewed almost immediately after her victory, however, when Chinese media began insisting that Chinshanlo was actually a Chinese national named Zhao Changling who had been loaned to Kazakhstan for a five year period beginning in 2008. Chinshanlo denied this, but drew scrutiny in October 2012 when the Chinese media claimed that she was in the process of preparing documents to return to China. She again refuted this, saying that she only planned to visit a former coach, but rumors swirled that Chinshanlo objective was to train worthy competition in other countries, as China had done in the past by loaning out its table tennis players.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected. Every women weightlifting event at the 2012 London Olympics, except flyweight (â¤ 48 kg), was affected by positive re-tests.
In October 2016 original gold medalist Zulfiya Chinshanlo (KAZ) lost her medal for a positive re-test for oxandrolone and stanozolol. In November 2016 original bronze medalist Cristina Iovu (MDA) lost her medal for a positive re-test for turinabol (dehydrochloromethyltestosterone). The medals were re-assigned as follows: Gold â Hsu Shu-Ching (TPE); Silver â Citra Febrianti (INA); Bronze â Yuliya Paratova (UKR). Febrianti received her medal at a ceremony in Indonesia in September 2022.

Hsu was not only the 2012 runner-up (and thus poised to become champion following Chinshanlo disqualification), but was also the reigning World champion and the 2014 runner-up. Romania Cristina Iovu, the 2012 Olympic bronze medalist and reigning European champion, also found herself entangled in a doping scandal and did not attend the 2016 Games. Other contenders included China Li Yajun, the 2013 World Champion and 2014 bronze medalist, and Hidilyn Diaz of the Philippines, the 2015 World bronze medalist. Yuliya Paratova of Ukraine, the 2013 and 2015 European champion and 2014 runner-up, competed in the flyweight division in Rio.
Li bested the Olympic record of her countrywoman Yang Xia, the 2000 Olympic champion, in the snatch with a 101 kg lift, but Hsu was only 1 kg behind. No other competitor lifted more than 90 kg, leaving Li and Hsu the only likely contenders for gold. In the clean and jerk, Li believed she had made a successful 123 kg lift and, far ahead of Hsu 112 kg first lift, attempted and failed 126 kg twice. The judges, however, had reversed their decision on Li 123 kg lift due to elbow bending and both Li and her coaches claimed not to have known this until after the competition had ended. Thus Hsu, who had failed to lift 126 kg in her second round, declined a third attempt and secured the bronze medal. Diaz also managed to record 112 kg in the clean and jerk, but her much lower snatch posting of 88 kg left her far behind overall in second place.

This division was one of the few women classes in which China had not been a dominant force in the past, having won only one medal, thanks to the gold medal of Yang Xia back in 2000 when women weightlifting was first held at the Olympic Games. In Tokyo, however, there was a clear favourite in Liao Qiuyun who had a season best of 222 kg. She was the reigning 2019 world champion and also the Asian champion in 2019 and 2020 (held in April 2021). Furthermore, she was the world record holder in clean & jerk (129 kg) and total (227 kg), both set at the 2019 World Championships. World record holder in snatch (102 kg), Li Yajun, was the 2018 world champion, and silver medallist at the last Asian Championships, where she set her season best with 221 kg. She represented China in the 53 kg class at Rio but, along with Zhang Wanqiong, twice runner-up at the 2018 and 2019 World Championships, both were not able to compete in Tokyo because of the one athlete per nation in each weight class rule. Liao first likely contender was Hidilyn Diaz, the 53 kg Rio silver medallist, who was competing in her fourth Olympics in Tokyo. She was the gold medallist from the 2018 Asian Games, when China was suspended, and was runner-up at the 2019 Asian Championships, but with a season best of 212 kg achieved at the Asian Championships held in April 2021, she was still ranked behind Muattar Nabieva. Nabieva finished third in the last two Asian Championships and had her season best with 213 kg. Also present in Tokyo was Zulfiya Chinshanlo, who lost her London 2012 gold medal due to doping, which was not discovered until October 2016. She did not have any significant results since then, having won her last world title back in 2014, placing fourth in the last Worlds and fifth in the last Asians, respectively. She went to Tokyo with a season best of 210 kg. Asian lifters dominated this event as only two non-Asians qualified through the rankings, Kamila Konotop (UKR), season best 212 kg, reigning European champion and World Junior champion, and also Ana LÃ³pez (MEX), season best 200 kg, and reigning Pan American champion.
As expected, the strongest snatcher in the field, Nabieva, took the lead after lifting 98 kg on her third attempt and Liao followed close behind with 97 kg. Diaz also gave a great performance by managing 97 kg with her second lift. She also tried 99 kg but failed to clear that weight. Konotop cleared 94 kg to bring herself in fourth position while Chinshanlo and Kristina Åermetowa followed with 90 kg each. In clean & jerk, Nabieva put in a good performance by her standard, lifting 114 kg for a total of 212 kg. She had a clear lead before the top three clean & jerkers started their competition after all the others had already finished. Liao started with 118 kg with her first lift, but Diaz countered with 119 kg. Chinshanlo started with 123 kg, which she cleared in her second attempt, and it brought all three ahead of Nabieva and secured a medal for them. Liao lifted 123 kg in her second attempt, but this was again countered by Diaz with 124 kg. This gave Chinshanlo bronze, but the race for gold was not over. Again, Liao started with a 126 kg, which meant that Diaz had to lift 127 kg in her last attempt as Liao had the lighter body weight. For the third time Diaz fought back and cleared 127 kg to win gold leaving silver for Liao, who was the only lifter in this field who did not miss any of her six attempts. This was also the first ever gold medal for the Philippines in Olympic history. The silver medal in this class would later turn out to be the only non-gold medal in weightlifting for China at these Games.
The Olympic Standard for Olympic records was 97 kg for snatch, 121 kg for clean & jerk, and 217 kg for total. The snatch record was taken by Nabieva with 98 kg. Liao twice set an Olympic record in clean & jerk with 123 kg and 126 kg, but it was bettered twice by Diaz with 124 kg and 127 kg. The same happened to the total record, where Liao established records with 220 kg and 223 kg only to the bettered by Diaz with 221 kg and 224 kg.

In fact, his brother, Yoshiyuki Miyake, had won the World Championships in 1969 and 1971, but he did not compete at the 1972 Olympics. The lead after the press was taken on bodyweight by Albanian Ymer Pampuri, who worked as a circus clown and was completely unknown. He would place last in the snatch, which was excusable when one understands he had never performed that lift in competition prior to the 1972 Olympics. Pampuri was tied after the press with Bulgarian Norair Nurikyan and Soviet Georgian Dito Shanidze, the 1968 Olympic silver medalist. Shanidze moved ahead after the snatch with Nurikyan 2.5 kg behind, tied with Hungarian JÃ¡nos Benedek. In the clean & jerk, Nurikyan lifted 157.5 kg for a world record, which gave him a total of 402.5 kg, to equal Shanidze world record and win the gold medal.

Ties broken by lightest bodyweight.,na,"The 1985-86 World Champion was Bulgarian Naum Shalamanov, who was actually born Naim Suleimanov. Suleimanov was a prodigy who began setting world records at age 15, and when only 16-years-old he became the second lifter to lift three times his body weight in the clean & jerk. He had Turkish ethnicity and was approached by Turkish lifting officials to change his nationality and compete for their country, but he refused. In 1984-85 the Bulgarian government began a crackdown on Turkish minorities and when Suleimanov returned from a training camp in Australia, his passport was conviscated and his name was changed to the more Bulgarian sounding Naum Shalamanov. This was the impetus he needed and at the 1986 World Cup competition in Melbourne, he left his team and sought asylum at the Turkish consulate. He then chose the Turkish name of Naim SÃ¼leymanoÄlu.
Olympic rules require an athlete to wait three years after changing nationality before representing the new nation at the Olympics, unless the two affected nations agree on a waiver. This waiver was âgivenâ in the form of over $1 million (US) transferred from the Turkish government to allow SÃ¼leymanoÄlu to compete as a Turk at the 1988 Olympics. He came to Seoul as an overwhelming favorite in the featherweight class.
SÃ¼leymanoÄlu did not disappoint his new nation, winning the gold medal by 30 kg over Bulgaria Stefan Topurov, who had won the 1987 World Championships when SÃ¼leymanoÄlu was not yet eligible to compete. In Seoul SÃ¼leymanoÄlu broke the world record in the snatch, the clean & jerk, and the total, lifting 342.5 kg, which also would have won the lightweight class, and was a remarkable 55 kg ahead of the bronze medalist, China He Yuanming. His total in Seoul is the highest total ever lifted using Sinclair Coefficients, which compares lifters of differing weights, and remained a world record until the weight classes were changed. He would return to win the gold medal at Barcelona in 1992 and Atlanta in 1996. During his career he won three Olympic Championships, seven overall World Championships, two overall European Championships, and set 46 world records. Through 2012 he remains the only lifter to snatch 21/2 times his bodyweight, and he is usually considered the strongest lifter ever, pound-for-pound.

Between 1920-36 it was 60 kg, and between 1948-2016 the lightest weight was at weights between 52 and 56 kg.
There were two clear favourites in China Li Fabin and Indonesia Eko Irawan. Li was the reigning 2019 world champion, and won silver behind Irawan in 2018. Li was also the winner of the last two Asian Championships in 2019 and 2020 (held in April 2021), and was the reigning world record holder in snatch (145 kg) and total (318 kg). Irawan, competing in his fourth Olympics, was world champion in 2018 and the gold medallist (in the 62 kg category) at the 2018 Asian Games, when China was suspended by the International Weightlifting Federation. Irawan was also the world record holder in clean & jerk with 174 kg. Other participants included Tháº¡ch Kim Tuáº¥n, gold medallist at the 2010 Youth Olympics and world champion in 2017 (both 56 kg class), Seraj Al-Saleem, season best 286 kg, and silver medallist at the last Asian Championships, Igor Son, qualification best 286 kg, and silver medallist at the last World Championships, and Shota Mishvelidze, qualification best 293 kg, silver medallist at the 2021 European Championships. The gold medallist at the last European Championships, Stilyan Grozdev, was not present in Tokyo as the Bulgarian federation was restricted to two male and two female lifters over all classes following more than ten doping violations. Also, not present in Tokyo was Francisco Mosquera (Colombia), season best 280 kg, world champion 2017 (62 kg) and bronze medallist at the last World Championships, who had previously missed the 2016 Olympics due to an injury. Ferdi Hardal (Turkey), with a season best 287 kg, and bronze medallist from the 2021 European Championships, also originally qualified for Tokyo. Mosquera was ranked fourth and Hardal ranked eighth, but their federations did not select them because of the restriction following many doping offences.
When Li and Irawan started with their snatch attempts all other competitors had already ended all their attempts with Yoichi Itokazu being in the lead with 133 kg. Irawan lifted 137 kg in his first attempt while Li failed at the same weight, but Irawan was not able to lift 141 kg in his next two attempts, while Li cleared 137 kg with his second and 141 kg with his third lift. This gave Li a margin of 4 kg before the clean & jerk; here again all other lifters had already finished their attempts with Son lifting 163 kg in his last attempt after Itokazu had already missed 162 kg in his final lift. That put Son in the bronze medal position, but he had to wait until Shota Mishvelidze and Seraj Al-Saleem had finished their attempts as both tried to lift weights good enough for bronze, but both failed. While Itokazu finished fourth, Irawan managed 165 kg in his first attempt, but as Li countered with 166 kg and also lifted 172 kg, Irawan had to go for a new world record, but missed the remaining two attempts over 177 kg. This gave Li gold and Irawan his second silver medal to go with the one he collected in 2016. Together with his two bronze medals from 2008 and 2012, Irawan medal tally increased to four, which made him the first and only Indonesian to win four medals at the Olympics. Remarkable was Li 166 kg clean & jerk lift, when he shifted his weight onto one leg and sticking out his right leg bringing it completely up off the ground, a move he had already shown in other competitions and called by his fans the âflamingo liftâ. He said he is doing this to correct his balance, not to impress the jury or the crowd.
The Olympic Standard for Olympic records was 142 kg for snatch, 171 kg for clean & jerk, and 310 kg for total. The standard was not reached in snatch, but in clean & jerk and total, Li established a record with 172 kg and 313 kg, respectively. China won its second gold medal at the Tokyo Games and Indonesia won its second medal with silver, after Windy Aisah won bronze the day before.

In 2006 he won the World Junior Championship, but then injured his back. The treatment for that injury almost killed him, as a pain injection injured his spinal cord, paralyzing his respiratory system, and he lapsed into a coma. However, Zhang recovered and qualified for the 2008 Olympics after the 2005-06 World Champion, Qiu Le, was injured at the 2007 Worlds. Zhang won the gold medal in Beijing easily, posting the best lift in both snatch and clean & jerk, and winning by 14 kg over Colombian Diego Fernando Salazar. Salazar had been bronze medalist in the class at the 2006 World Championships and was a two-time Pan American Games Champion (2003/07). His medal was the first ever in Olympic weightlifting by a Colombian man, although Colombia had women win medals in both 2000 and 2004. The bronze medal in Beijing went to Indonesian Triyatno (his only name), who also won a bronze medal as a lightweight at the 2012 Olympics.

However, he was encouraged to come out of retirement by IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch and go for a fourth gold medal. That did not last long as SÃ¼leymanoÄlu missed all three snatch attempts, was out of the competition, and then retired for good. The favorites were Greece Leonidas Sabanis, the 1998 World Champion, Croatia Nikolay Peshalov, and China Le Maosheng, the 1999 World Champion. Peshalov had been an Olympic silver medalist in 1992 and bronze medalist as a bantamweight in 1996, but while competing for Bulgaria. He had changed allegiance to Croatia, with Croatia paying for the right to allow him to compete for them.
Peshalov took the lead in the snatch with 150.0 kg, and then extended it in the clean & jerk, equalling the world record with a total of 325.0 kg to win the gold medal. He would return in 2004 and win a fourth Olympic medal, a bronze, as a lightweight. Behind Peshalov, there was a three-way tie on total with 317.5 kg between Sabanis, Belarussian Gennady Oleshchuk, and Bulgarian Sevdalin Minchev, however Minchev was disqualified for doping for using Lasix (furosemide), a powerful diuretic often used as a masking agent to enable athletes to evade doping positives. Sabanis won the silver medal on bodyweight as Le placed fourth and missed the podium.

Lifting 142 kg in the snatch to take the lead in the competition, Figueroa sealed his victory by lifting 176 kg in the clean & jerk (318 kg total), which he followed with three unsuccessful attempts at a world-record weight of 179 kg. In an Olympic career that started with a 5th place in 2004, a DNF in 2008, a silver medal in 2012, and then after failing in his last lift with his gold medal already secured in Rio, Figueroa took off his shoes and placed them on the platform, signaling his immediate retirement from the sport. He had become his country first-ever Olympic men weightlifting champion, and only the second Colombian gold medalist since MarÃ­a Isabel Urrutia lifted her way to the heavyweight gold in 2000.
Irawan captured the silver with a combined total of 312 kg, with the Chinese-born Kazakh Farkhad Kharki, back after a two-year doping suspension, claiming the bronze medal, at 305 kg.

Having wrestled her entire senior career at 55 kg, Yoshida chose to drop to 53 kg when the Olympic weights for women changed. She also won World titles at the lower weight following its introduction o the Worlds in 2014.
Also dropping to the lower weight class was American Helen Maroulis, the 2015 World champion at 55 kg. She also won a World silver in 2012 and bronze in 2014, which was the last time she had been beaten. However, she was struggling to make the lower weight the entire year, but never gave up on her plan to stop the Yoshida machine. With the exception of Yoshida, Maroulis had beaten everyone else in the field, and was looking to take down the Japanese star, avenging her loss to her in the 2012 World Championships final, when she was pinned in four minutes.
Also in contention for a medal was a very motivated two-time Olympian (2008, 2012), the 2009 World champion (51 kg) and six-time World medalist Sofia Mattsson of Sweden, who lost to Yoshida in the last two World Championship finals, and had a recent loss to Maroulis.
En-route to the gold medal match Maroulis pinned World No.2 Mattsson in one semi-final, while Yoshida destroyed Betzabeth ArgÃ¼ello of Venezuela in the other.
The titanic showdown had so much on the line with Yoshida, a massive celebrity in Japan, as the reigning World champion at 53 kg; Maroulis was the reigning World champion at 55 kg. More importantly, Maroulis was seeking the first gold medal in women wrestling for the USA, while Yoshida was trying to become the second wrestler to ever win four Olympic gold medals, one day after her teammate Kaori Icho became the first.
In the gold medal match, Yoshida scored first, then the younger, stronger, confident and patient Maroulis, who had studied Yoshida for the past four years, scored a takedown on a twisting move, and took a 4-1 lead to capture the gold medal.
Azerbaijan Nataliya SiniÅin won one bronze beating ArgÃ¼ello. In the other bronze bout, while Mattsson pinned China Zhong Xuechun 32 seconds into the match making her the second Swede to earn a bronze medal in Olympic wrestling, after fellow teammate Jenny Fransson took home the nation first ever women Olympic wrestling medal (69 kg) the day before.

Competitors losing to the finalists entered repechage tournament for bronze medals.,na,"Despite never having competed in a senior World Championship, Russia Dzhamal Otarsultanov was considered the favorite for the men freestyle featherweight event at the 2012 Olympics. Having won the last two European Championships, Otarsultanov defeated compatriot Viktor Lebedev, the reigning World Champion for the past two years, for Russia flyweight spot at the London Games. Among his most prominent challengers were Yang Kyong-Il of North Korea, the 2009 World Champion and 2011 Asian Champion, and Hassan Rahimi of Iran, the reigning Asian Champion. Notable as an underdog was Brandon Escobar of Honduras, his nation first Olympic wrestler.
Yang and Otarsultanov were drawn in the same half, with the latter defeating the former in the quarterfinals on his way to the gold medal match. This left Rahimi as his most likely challenger, but the Iranian was defeated by 18 year-old Indian Amit Kumar, who had dÃ©buted on the international scene earlier in the year with a bronze medal at the 2012 Asian Championships, a tournament won by Rahimi. Kumar in turn was overcome by Georgia Vladimer Khinchegashvili, a two-time junior World Champion (2010 and 2011) who had finished seventh at the senior World Championships and only reached the Olympics by winning the European qualifier. With his subsequent defeat of Japan Shinichi Yumoto, the 2010 Asian Champion, however, he guaranteed himself a medal in London. The first period of the final went to par terre, where Otarsultanov drew the advantaged position and converted it into a score to win the round. In the second period, the Russian scored point with a takedown in the first ten seconds that was answered soon after by the Georgian pushing his opponent out of the ring. Each scored another point in the second half of the round, but an unsuccessful challenge from the Russian coaches put Khinchegashvili ahead 3-2. Refusing to drag the match on to a third period, Otarsultanov scored another point, to which the Georgian attempted to respond in the dying seconds of the round. When he was not awarded the points, and with nothing to lose (since Otarsultanov had scored the last point and would have won the period anyways), it was the Georgian coachesâ turn for an unsuccessful challenge, leaving the Russian to win the round and capture the gold medal.
For the first of the two third-place podium spots, Yang squared off against Daulet Niyazbekov of Kazakhstan, a bronze medalist from the most recent World Championships. The two seemed evenly, and aggressively, matched at first, with almost the entire first minute spent on the ground and each scoring two points in a first round that went to Yang for having scored the last point. In a conclusion to perhaps one of the most entertaining matches of the tournament, however, Yang displayed complete dominance and won the round early by scoring six unanswered points, earning himself a victory in the match. In the second bronze medal bout, Yumoto faced Radoslav Velikov of Bulgaria, a distinguished wrestler who had won, among other accolades, a bronze medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics, gold at the 2006 World Championships, and silver at the 2005 and 2011 editions. They too were evenly matched, scoring one point each in the first two rounds, but Yumoto was declared the winner of the period in each case and, consequently, of the second bronze medal.

The 25-year-old had not lost a match in this class since the 2014 World Championships, and was one of the best wrestlers pound-for-pound. Outside of him, the other favourite had to be Hassan Rahimi of Iran who, in the last three seasons, has won gold (2013), silver (2015) and bronzes (2011, 2014) at the World Championships. Two other men in the field had medalled at higher weights at the World Championships and came down a class for the Olympics in Rio â Yowlys Bonne of Cuba, a World bronze medalist (2014) and 2012 Olympian was world-ranked number three, while Bulgaria Vladimir Dubov won a World bronze in 2015.
But in the end, it was Khinchegashvili in the match for Rio gold against Japan Rei Higuchi who, at just 20 years of age, came out of nowhere â and en route to the final, took out the Cuban Bonne in the quarter-finals and 2013 World champion Hassan Rahimi of Iran in the semi-finals. The edge was held by Higuchi, 3-2, late in the second period, but Higuchi was then put on the shot clock with 1:13 left in the bout, failing to score, giving a point to Khinchegashvili who was ahead based on tie-breaking criteria. An unsuccessful challenge from Higuchi corner at the very end resulted in an extra point going to Khinchegashvili to make the final score 4-3. Higuchi came within inches from Olympic glory in his Games debut.
Azerbaijan HacÄ± Æliyev, the two-time World champion, had to drop down to 57 kg because his normal weight class (61 kg) was not on the Olympic programme and he found himself wrestling with Khinchegashvili, the reigning 57 kg world champion, in the quarter-finals. This match of two reigning World champions going head-to-head had Khinchegashvili narrowly winning the bout 5-3, but Aliyev wrestled back through the repÃªchage to win one of the bronze medals.
The second bronze was won by Rahimi who recovered from his loss to Higuchi to pin Bonne in the bronze medal match with about a minute left on the clock.

Soryan was a five-time World Champion (2005-2007, 2009-2010) and a strong prospect to win Iran first Olympic gold medal in Greco-Roman wrestling. He had taken the past season off, however, allowing Bayramov to claim the title of reigning World Champion. Both were veterans of the 2008 Games, but had never met at the Olympics, as Soryan was defeated by eventual gold medalist Nazyr Mankiyev in the quarterfinals. Bayramov had survived to the final match, although he too was outclassed by Mankiyev and forced to settle for silver.  With Mankiyev having bowed out of defending his crown, the opportunity was ripe for either wrestler to capture the crown.
Up through the final, Bayramov never suffered a single point in his matches, making him appear to be the strongest contender for gold. Soryan struggled somewhat against his first opponent, Arsen Eraliyev of Kyrgyzstan, but managed to avoid taking any more points in the quarter or semi-finals. The first period of the final went scoreless for 90 seconds, necessitating a par terre finish where Soryan was able to score for two points. In the second period, Soryan converted one of Bayramov attacks into a point advantage, which was all he needed to claim his nation first Olympic Greco-Roman crown.
In the first bronze medal match, Hungarian PÃ©ter MÃ³dos defeated Denmark HÃ¥kan Nyblom in three periods. Each round went to par terre and, although the Dane successfully defended in the first period, he was penalized for a leg grab and lost the round 0-3. MÃ³dos was unable to defend when on the bottom, giving the second round to Nyblom and extending the match to a third period. Scoreless at the end of 90 seconds, and with their points and cautions tied, a ball was drawn to determine which competitor would choose the positions in the final par terre. MÃ³dos won and chose to be on top, successfully scoring on Nyblom and earning the podium spot. The second bout, between Mingiyan Semyonov of Russia and Choi Gyu-Jin of South Korea, was more straightforward but far more aggressive.

Only participants competing in the team all-around could start in this event (with an exception noted below), although the score strangely did not count for the team all-around, either. Only one individual routine was performed.
The Swiss did not have a team, but Georges Miez received special permission to start and won the silver medal, beaten only by the Hungarian IstvÃ¡n Pelle, the silver medalist in the individual all-around. Bronze went to the Italian Mario Lertora.
Miez was the only Swiss participant in Los Angeles and in his four Olympic appearances from 1924-36 won four golds, three silvers and one bronze medal. In Los Angeles he considered his floor exercise scores very devalued, and resigned in anger from the competitions, after loudly confronting the judges with no success. He then embarked on a trip throughout the US, where he also worked and held speeches at universities. Nonetheless, with other Swiss gymnasts, Miez pointed the way ahead for the development of floor gymnastics, because the Swiss team introduced a flowing style of movement.

Injury-free in 2012, she was considered a strong favorite to take home the Olympic crown. She would not go unchallenged, however: Panida Khamsri of Thailand, runner-up at the most recent World Championships, was considered a favorite for a medal as well. The reigning European Champion, Marzena KarpiÅska of Poland, had certainly improved since her ninth place finish at the 2008 Summer Games, but was barred from London after being suspected of doping violations. This left Nurdan KaragÃ¶z of Turkey, twice runner-up at the European Championships (2010 and 2011) and bronze medalist at the most recent World Championships, as Europe best hope for a medal.
Khamrsi exited the competition early, failing to lift her initial snatch weight of 81 kg within three tries, leaving the podium spots more open than ever. Wang was placed first following the snatch competition, with a final lift of 91 kg, four kilograms more than her closest competitor, Hiromi Miyake of Japan. Miykae was the daughter of Yoshiyuki Miyake, a bronze medalist in 1968 in the men featherweight division, and the niece of Yoshinobu Miyake, twice Olympic featherweight champion and once bantamweight runner-up in four Olympics from 1960 through 1972. KaragÃ¶z was in third in the snatch, with 83 kg. In the clean and jerk, Wang did not have her first lift until most of her competitors had lifted two or three times. Her first attempt came in at 110 kg and was successful, which was enough in the end to win the competition. With the bar already set too high, Ryang Chun-Hwa of North Korea then made an attempt at 112 kg to move into the bronze medal position, which was successful and displaced Sirivimon Pramongkhol of Thailand. Meanwhile Miyake, who was already in the silver medal position after lifting 110 kg, did not challenge for the gold, trying, and failing, to set a personal best with 113 kg. Wang final two lifts were superfluous, successfully lifting 114 kg but failing in her third attempt with 116 kg.

The defending champion, Turkey Nurcan Taylan, competed in Beijing but missed all three attempts in the snatch and was eliminated. She kissed the discs on the left side of her barbell as she left the lifting platform.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected. Of note, every women weightlifting event from the 2008 Beijing Olympics was affected by positive re-tests for PEDs.

The Thai gold medallist from Rio, Sopita Tanasan, and her compatriot Chayuttra Pramongkhol were both convicted of doping. Pramongkhol lost her gold medal from the 2018 World Championships and also the world records both lifters had set had been nullified. These were just two of the huge number of doping offences in Thailand, which led to them being one of four nations to be excluded from the weightlifting at the Tokyo Olympics. Another excluded nation was Romania, and this prevented the 2021 European champion Monica Csengeri from participating in Tokyo, but she had already tested positive in 2018. This made Kristina Sobol from Russia, qualification best 187 kg, the highest placed European competitor in this class. Originally qualified for this event was VÆ°Æ¡ng Thá» Huyá»n, but she was not nominated by her federation as Vietnam was restricted to one male and one female lifter over all classes as a result of 20 doping violations.
When the strongest snatcher, Hou, lifted 88 kg in her first attempt, only two other athletes were still competing, but both Chanu and Delacruz failed to lift 89 kg. Hou went on to lift 92 kg and 94 kg in her next attempts for a solid lead after snatch, with Chanu in second place with 87 kg followed by Delacruz (86 kg) and Aisah (84 kg). Hou was untouchable, and in clean & jerk lifted all her three attempts to finally clear 116 kg as she also cleared all three snatch attempts. She was the only lifter in this event to do so. The best clean & jerker, Chanu, failed to lift her last attempt for 117 kg, but she had already lifted 115 kg in her second try to secure a clear silver medal. As Delacruz failed to lift any weight in clean & jerk, she missed 108 kg three times, Aisah won bronze after clearing 110 kg for a total of 194 kg. The best lifter from group B, held in the morning, was the Cuban Montero, with a total of 178 kg, which finally placed her sixth.
The Olympic Standard for Olympic records was 89 kg for snatch, 111 kg for clean & jerk, and 198 kg for total. The snatch record was broken twice by Hou with 92 kg and 94 kg. The clean & jerk record was first reached by Hou with 114 kg, then bettered by Chanu with 115 kg, and finally went back to Hou with 116 kg. The total record was first set by Hou in her first clean & jerk attempt totalling 203 kg and increased by her to 208 kg and then to 210 kg.
This result meant China had started perfectly in the Tokyo weightlifting competition as they sought to once again top the medal standings, as they had done in all editions since 2000, winning five gold medals at each Games between then and Rio 2016. Chanu, the only weightlifter from India taking part in the Tokyo Games, won only the second ever Olympic weightlifting medal for her country after Karnam Malleswari, who won bronze back in 2000. Tokyo bronze medallist Aisah, born 11 June 2002, became the youngest weightlifting medallist at these Games aged 19 years 43 days. Finishing fifth, Nina Sterckx secured the best ever result by a female lifter from Belgium and sixth placed Montero gave Cuba their best ever female weightlifting finish. Also participating in this event was Dika Toua from Papua New Guinea who, after missing the 2016 Games, became, along with Japan Miyake, the first ever female weightlifter to compete in five Olympics. Both also equalled the participation record held by Imre FÃ¶ldi, Ingo SteinhÃ¶fel, and Ronny Weller.

Carol Huynh of Canada, the defending Olympic Champion, had been Commonwealth Games Champion (2010) and twice Pan-American Games Champion (2007 and 2011) but never World Champion. The true favorite was Hitomi Obara of Japan, a six-time World Champion in the non-Olympic 51 kg class (2000, 2001, 2005-2008) who had switched to the flyweight in 2010 and captured the last two World Championships in the division. The field was rounded out with two other former World Champions, Clarissa Chun of the United States (2008) and Mariya Stadnik of Azerbaijan (2009), ensuring that no medal in the event would go unchallenged.
Huynh was drawn in the same half as Obara, to whom she lost in the semi-finals as the Japanese competitor charged for gold. The rest duked it out in the bottom half, where Stadnik defeated Chun in the 1/8 finals and Merlini in the semi-finals, earning the right to challenge Obara supremacy. In an aggressive first period of the final match, Stadnik became the first competitor in the event to get the best of Obara, winning the round 4-0. Obara, however, was unflappable and converted her loss into a passion for victory, which brought 1-0 and 2-0 wins over the next two periods and an Olympic crown to add her laurels.
In the first bronze medal match, Huynh met Isabelle Sambou of Senegal, vying to capture her country second Olympic medal ever. Sambou put up a valiant effort against the far more experienced Huynh, forcing the Olympic Champion to par terre in both periods, but she had the misfortune of drawing the disadvantaged position in both rounds and was defeated by the Canadian, who won her second Olympic medal. Chun and Merleni, meanwhile, battled for the final podium spot in a relatively more interesting match. In the first period, Chun took down her opponent at the buzzer, scoring the round-winning point, before throwing the Ukrainian to the mat for a decisive, three-point victory in the second that earned her the second bronze medal.

If so, the maximum length of the foil blade was 34 inches (86 cm). The target area was the body âwithin the limits bounded by the collar of the fencing jacket, the median line, the hip, and a line drawn from the hip to the posterior limit of the armpit, around the front of the arm and along the crest of the shoulder to the collarâ. The âmedian lineâ referred to a vertical line running down the middle of the front of the torso which meant that touches were valid only to the half of the torso on the side of the fencing arm. Touches to the other side of the torso were not valid. Touches to the back were also not valid.
As was common in Europe, the winner of a foil bout was not determined by the number of touches scored but rather based on the evaluation by the judges. They would have been using a head judge and either two or four side judges for each of the bouts. The fencers bouted for four minutes of actual fencing time, switching sides after two. At the end of the bout: âEach judge without consulting his fellow judges shall award 100 points or any part thereof to each contestant at the end of the bout. The score shall be the average of the sum of the points obtained. The award of each judge shall be announced at the end of each bout.â The fencer whose average score was the highest was the winner of the bout. So, no touch counts are shown in the results because they were not used to determine the winners.
This had the largest field of any 1904 fencing event with nine competitors, which required two preliminary pools to advance four fencers to the final round. There were also fencers from four nations â Cuba, Germany, Great Britain, and the United States.

Fonst also won gold in St. Louis with the Ã©pÃ©e, and had won that weapon at the 1900 Olympics in Paris, and in team foil in 1904. Albertson Van Zo Post won the silver medal, one of five fencing medals he won in St. Louis. He would also compete again at the 1912 Olympics for the United States, but won no medals in Stockholm.

DâOriola failure to win the 1955 World Championship was partly attributed to his failure to adapt to the new electric foil that was introduced at the championships. By the Melbourne Games it seemed he had overcome his temporary difficulties and adapted to the new technology.

CassarÃ  was also ranked first in the FIE rankings, although Aspromonte was seeded first in the Olympic tournament. Third Italian on the squad was Andrea Baldini. He had missed the 2008 Games, after it was reported he had failed a drug test. He was cleared of the accusations several months later, immediately earning the World and European titles of 2009. Germany had entered defending champion, Benjamin Kleibrink, and the four-time World Champion, Peter Joppich. Earlier in the 2012 season, Lei Sheng had earned the Asian title, while European gold was claimed by Aleksey Cheremisinov, two months before the Olympics.
The first casualties fell in the round of 32, where Kleibrink was served revenge by Yuki Ota, who had lost the 2008 Olympic final to him. Joppich suffered defeat at the hands of Alaaeldin Abouelkassem, the 2010 Junior World Champion. Abouelkassem, son of an Egyptian father and Algerian mother, had suffered his father death just a few months before the Olympics, but this did not stop him from upsetting also CassarÃ  in the quarter-finals. Lei Sheng, a three-time World Championship medallist, took care of the other two Italians, outscoring Aspromonte in the quarter-finals, and Baldini in the semis. The Chinese and the Egyptian met in the final, where Lei took a 8-5 lead in the first period. Abouelkassem recovered to lead by two points at 13-11, but then received four touches in a row to give the title to Lei. With the bronze taken by Choi Byeong-Cheol of South Korea, the entire podium was taken by non-European fencers. This had not happened since 1904, when only Cuban and American foil fencers competed.

The drama continued in the round of 16 where a bout between reigning Olympic champion Philippe OmnÃ¨s and Cuban Elvis Gregory dissolved into acrimony.

Puccini won by a score of 15-12 to record what would be the only major individual win of his career. France claimed another medal when Franck Boidin won the bronze medal.

There were 22 fencers who fenced 12 matches, eight in the French style and four used the Italian style. One interesting note about the foil demonstration is that one woman fenced against the men, Millicent Hall, who was the British ladiesâ foil champion in 1907-08 and 1922.
There were no real final standings because the event was meant to demonstrate the different styles of foil fencing being practiced in the 12 countries and those styles were so different that there was no basis for comparing them to each other.  No scores were kept during the bouts. The description of the event in the 1908 Official Report says that neither hits scored nor form were used to award touches: âTo base decisions purely on the hits scored encourages a degraded form of foil-play, and the differences of style in so many nations would have made it an invidious matter to take form into consideration.â

Italians had won all 3 World Championship titles and 7 of the 12 available medals since then and a medal sweep at Beijing seemed not merely possible but highly probable.
So it was no great surprise when the Italian trio of two-time defending champion Valentina Vezzali, Atlanta champion Giovanna Trillini and former World Champion Margherita Granbassi breezed past their opposition and into the semi-finals. The one spanner in the works was the presence of Korean Nam Hyeon-Hui who was ranked 3rd in the world.
Vezzali duly booked her place in the final with a win over Granbassi but the dream of an all-Italian final ended when Nam defeated the veteran Trillini.
The final was a cautious low scoring affair with Vezzali early lead being pegged back by the Korean.
With 40 seconds to go Nam took the lead for the first time but the Italian levelled and, with four seconds remaining, scored the decisive score to ensure she won her third successive Olympic title. Granbassi defeated Trillini for the bronze medal. Vezzali would win a fifth successive Olympic medal in this event when she took bronze in 2012.

Badea ousted Trillini in a classic semi-final where the Italian fought back from a seemingly impossible position to draw level at 14-14 before the Romania forced the decisive hit.

All eyes were on Vezzali at London where she would attempt to win an unprecedented fourth successive Olympic title in the event. She was even chosen to carry the Italian flag at the Opening Ceremony.
The women foil proved a lot more predictable than the male equivalent and the semi-final line-up of three Italians and the Italian based Nam Hyeon-Hui of Korea exactly matched most of the predictions made before the Games.
The first semi-final matched Di Francisca and Nam and set the trend for the final matches of the tournament. The Italian was four points down with a minute to go but forced a tie in the dying seconds of the bout then won the sudden death decider. The second bout saw the dreams of Vezzali becoming a four time winner of the gold medal in foil end at the hands of her younger team mate Arianna Errigo by 15-12.
For most of the final it seemed that Errigo would defeat her more experienced compatriot Di Francisca.  With 45 seconds left on the clock Di Francisca needed to cancel a deficit of three points to remain in the gold medal hunt and that is exactly what she did by making three lightning fast hits to ensure the bout went to extra time. Di Francisca gambled on a swift attack at the sudden death phase and hit the golden jackpot within a second of the start of the extra period.
The bronze medal contest between Vezzali and Nam was nearly a carbon copy of the final but with the twist that the Italian veteran recovered from a slightly greater margin (four points) in a smaller period of time (18 seconds) to force extra time. A well timed counter attack from Vezzali then ensured that she took bronze and that Italy would make a sweep of the medals. This was the first Italy had swept the podium in any Olympic event since 1956.
Although Vezzali failed to become the first fencer to win four successive titles in any individual event she did win a record fifth successive medal in the discipline.

The surprise of the event and of all the fencing competitions was Britain Gillian Sheen. Sheen had been national champion since 1951 but had never been more than a fringe contender at the highest level. She started well at the first round stage but struggled at the semi-final stage and only claimed two wins out of five. Sheen had to survive a barrage against world champion Lidia DÃ¶mÃ¶lky to reach the final pool. The Briton lost her opening match to Olga Orban-Szabo of Romania but then went on a run of six victories, mostly nail-bitingly close, that left her level with the Romania on top of the group table.

In the excitement of the victory, the British team manager rushed out to congratulate her, tripped and only narrowly avoided being impaled on her sword. Her win was so surprising that no British journalist thought it worth covering the event.

The only ray of hope still left after the Italian women had been so dominant in sweeping the podium in the individual event was that they did the same thing at the 2011 World Championships before losing to Russia in the team final that year.
They pretty much demolished their British hosts and then France to set up a rematch with the Russians in the London final. This time there was to be no repeat for Russia and they never got a toehold in the gold medal contest. It was left to 38-year-old veteran Valentina Vezzali to deliver the coup de grace on Russia thereby helping Italy to the Olympic title and herself to a sixth career Olympic gold. She had won a medal in each of the nine Olympic events she contested between 1996 and 2012.
The bronze medal was won by South Korea, their first ever in Olympic team fencing.
Vezzali was elected to the Italian Parliament in 2013 as a member of the newly formed centrist Scelta Civica party led by former Prime Minister Mario Monti.

Not one of the medallists from the 1965 Worlds was present at Grenoble whilst both the 1966 and 1967 championships were abandoned.
The tragic death of Germany Toni Pensburger curtailed the 1966 event whilst adverse weather conditions meant that the next year championships were never even started.
Eugenio Monti of Italy had defeated his Olympic jinx in the two man event and entered the four man competition as favourite despite it being seven years since his last world title in the event. 
The weather again threatened to ruin proceedings but after two days were abandoned the racing eventually got underway albeit restricted to two runs instead of the scheduled four.  Monti did not disappoint and posted the fastest time of the first run. Behind him were the Austria I quartet piloted by Edwin Thaler and the second Italian crew. The fastest times of the second run was posted by Switzerland I, which moved them into the bronze medal position, and by Thaler Austrians but Monti was not to be denied. His lead was cut to less than a tenth of a second but that was sufficient to make sure that he became the first man to win both bobsleigh events at a single Winter Games.
This was the last race of Monti illustrious career which had seen him gather nine world titles in addition to his six Olympic medals and a reputation for fair play. He retired from competition to pursue his business interests but stayed in the sport as manager of the Italian team. After suffering from Parkinson disease for close on two decades Monti ended his own life in 2003.
Further down the field were two men who found success in the world of motor racing. Both Boris Said, Jr of the United States and Briton Robin Widdows competed at the top level of the sport and participated in Formula One Grand Prix races.

After the first run, a similar margin separated the next eight racers as Å½an Kranjec in ninth position, was 0.62 seconds behind Pinturault, followed by Kristoffersen in 10th.
In the second run Ryan Cochran-Siegle, placed 21st after the first run, clocked the third best time to finish 11th overall and, with the best time of the second run, Kristoffersen won silver, just 4/100ths of a second ahead of Pinturault. Hirscher was untouchable, with the second-best time in the second run to become the first and only double Olympic champion in Alpine skiing at these Games. He dominated the event as Kristoffersen was 1.27 seconds in arrears. The three favorites shared the medals and were in the same order as in the seasonal giant slalom World Cup. Hirscher raced Atomic, Kristoffersen used Rossignol, and Pinturault won bronze with Head skis.

Chenal was a bit better known, having previously posted three podium finishes in the GS in World Cup races, with one win. Maier was tied for third, with Raich in fifth after the first run. Another contender, 2003 World Champion Bode Miller, struggled into 12th position, as he was having a horrible Olympics for him. On the second run, Bourque fell back to form, placing 12th on the run, to drop out of the medals. Raich won the run over Chenal, with Maier third and Miller fourth.

The start of the piste within the Rosa Khutor Alpine Center was located at an altitude of 1,370 metres right above âBig Panâ and followed almost the lower part of the downhill course. There was only one clear favorite, American Ted Ligety. He won the World Championships in giant slalom in both 2011 and 2013 as well as the giant slalom World Cup in 2010/11 and 2012/13. He had also won three of the five World Cup giant slaloms in the current season, in SÃ¶lden, Beaver Creek, and St. Moritz. The slope here in Sochi was described as similar to Beaver Creek which was also an advantage for Ligety. His biggest challengers were expected to be Marcel Hirscher, silver medalist at the 2013 World Championships and giant slalom World Cup winner in 2011/12, who won two races in this winter at Val dâIsÃ¨re and Alta Badia, Felix Neureuther who won the World Cup giant slalom in Adelboden, Alexis Pinturault, and the silver medalist from Vancouver, and Kjetil Jansrud, who had already won two medals in Sochi. But Neureuther was handicaped after a car accident in Germany only five days before, causing whiplash. The current giant slalom World Cup standings saw Hirscher in the lead with Pinturault second, Ligety third, and Fanara fourth.
Pinturault was first down on the first run, and posted a challenging time of 1:22.44. This held the lead until his compatriot Thomas Fanara (FRA) bettered the time by just 0.03 seconds. Shortly afterwards Ligety posted a time of 1:21.08 which put him in the lead after the first run. No skier approached Ligety time, the best of the rest being surprising OndÅej Bank (CZE) who was 0.93 seconds behind, Davide Simoncelli (ITA) at 1.27 seconds behind and Matthias Mayer (AUT) who trailed by 1.33 seconds in the same time as Fanara.
With the top 30 going in reverse order on the second run, the first skier to make an impression on the medal positions was Steve Missillier (FRA), 10th after the first run, but in what was to prove the fastest time of the second run in 1:23.19, which put him into the lead with a combined time of 2:45.77. Pinturault then came close but failed by 0.16 seconds to overtake his compatriot. Fanara, Mayer and Simoncelli went without challenging the leaders, and for a while Hirscher found himself in bronze medal position. Bank was next on the course but, perhaps with memories of missing out in the Super Combined event when lying second, only managed the 15th fastest second run and slipped down to eventually finish fifth. Going last Ligety did not have the best race, and his 1.50 second lead over Missillier was gradually eroded, but he just held on to post a combined time of 2:45.29 and take the gold medal, ahead of the two Frenchmen.
Ligety won the fifth gold medal at this Games for skiing manufacturer Head, while Salomon won silver and bronze. OndÅej Bank achieved the best ever Alpine skiing result for a Czech men by finishing fifth.

Girardelli had been a four-time overall World Cup champion, and coming into Albertville was considered the greatest skier without an Olympic medal, although he had ended that in the super-G with a silver. Girardelli was born in Austria and lived mostly in Switzerland. He had acquired Luxembourgeois citizenship after he and his father had disputes with the Austrian ski team. He had been unable to compete at the 1984 Winter Olympics because he did not obtain his citizenship in time, and although he competed at Calgary in 1988, he struggled there.
There were 131 skiers in the event, the largest entry ever in Winter Olympic skiing, and the first run seemingly took forever to complete. To make it more time-consuming, the course was not that difficult and a full 109 skiiers finished and competed in the second run. The first run went according to form, with Tomba leading, following by Girardelli, Aamodt, and Accola. Tomba again posted the fastest time in the second run, to defend his gold medal, with the order unchanged â Girardelli getting his second silver in Albertville, Aamodt winning bronze, and Accola in fourth place.

The second run was marred by bad weather, with light snow and fog coming in, which caused the competition to be re-started for this run. When it was re-started Switzerland Ueli Kestenholz went off sixth and posted the fastest run of the round. Two boarders later, Rebagliati posted what would be the second fastest run in the second round, and moved into first place overall. He waited out the next seven boarders, and when Anderson struggled into 22nd place on the run, Rebagliati had the gold medal, with Prugger in second and Kestenholz third.
Or so it seemed. Three days later it was announced that Rebagliati would be stripped of his gold medal because he had tested positive for marijuana. This was immediately appealed by the Canadian Olympic Committee, and sent for a decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The ruling came down in Rebagliati favor, based on the fact that marijuana was considered a restricted substance, rather than a prohibited substance. The FIS explained that they had requested marijuana testing only for âfear related eventsâ and not snowboarding. This was important, because snowboarders had somewhat of an alternative lifestyle, often with lots of partying, and marijuana was frequently present at the parties. Rebagliati explained that he had not recently been using, but had attended several parties at which there was a lot of marijuana use and he thought his positive was due to second-hand smoke. After the CAS ruling, Rebagliati was allowed to keep his gold medal.
Finishing in seventh place overall was Austrian Martin Freinademetz, who later had his Olympic Acceditation revoked. During a party at the Shiga Kogen Prince Hotel, he became quite drunk, and damaged a $4,000 switchboard. He offered to pay for the damage but the IOC was not amused.

Kristoffersen won the Crystal Globe in 2020 and Pinturault in 2021, with Kristoffersen also becoming world champion in 2019. The reigning world champion from 2021, however, was Mathieu Faivre.
The ongoing World Cup season, with five races already contested, saw Marco Odermatt dominate and he had already finished second in the 2021 giant slalom standings. Odermatt won four races in SÃ¶lden, Val-dâIsÃ¨re, Alta Badia 2, and Adelboden, being beaten only in Alta Badia 1 by Kristoffersen. The current standings showed Odermatt holding a big lead from Manuel Feller, Kristoffersen, and Pinturault.
The race day started with a surprise with a heavy snow fall overnight. As all the slopes had been prepared with man-made snow in an area with very little natural snow fall, it put the event to the test. The organisers did their best and the first run started on time although the piste was only cleaned from the snow on a small track and visibility was poor. This had little effect on Odermatt, who set the best run time. Surprisingly next to him was Stefan Brennsteiner with bib number 12 and he missed the top time by only 0.04 seconds. Faivre came third another 0.04 seconds and Kristoffersen in fourth was again 0.04 seconds back. In difficult circumstances the first ten were close together and within a second, just behind was Pinturault, who was already 1.06 seconds behind Odermatt.
On the second run Pinturault was able to improve to fifth place overall and the bronze and silver medals went to Faivre and Å½an Kranjec, who improved from eighth place after the first run with the best time in the second run. After Brennsteiner could only finish 27th after a big mistake, Odermatt set the second-best run time to finally win gold 0.19 seconds ahead of Kranjec, who was the first ever medallist in this event for Slovenia.
Remarkable in ninth place, after setting the third best time in the second run, was Andorran Joan VerdÃº, who had never had a top 30 finish in the World Cup, but achieved his country best ever Winter Olympics result and equalled the overall best Olympic result for Andorra, being only 3/100ths of a second behind Kristoffersen.

The standings saw Ligety in the lead, followed by Blardone and Hirscher, who was the only racer to win two races in the current season and was also the last winner in Kranjska Gora about three weeks before the Olympics. Bode Miller, silver medalist in the 2002 giant slalom, who had already won a medal of each color in Vancouver, and Aksel Lund Svindal, with gold in the Super G and silver in the downhill, were considered podium candidates. The reigning world champion was Janka, who won gold in Val dâIsÃ¨re 2009 with Benjamin Raich in second and Ligety in third. Raich (gold) was also the only medalist from Torino still competing as silver medalist JoÃ«l Chenal retired in 2009 and bronze medalist Hermann Maier retired just before the 2009-10 season. Only two World Cup giant slaloms had ever been held in Whistler. Ingemar Stenmark won there in 1975 while Hannes Reichelt won on 23 February 2008, but he did not qualify for this event in Vancouver.
Decided over two runs, the main surprise of the first run was the elimination of Miller, who missed a gate. At the end of the first run Janka was the leader with a time of 1:17.27, a mere 0.02 seconds ahead of Romed Baumann, Svindal 0.16 seconds back. So close was the run that less than one second separated Janka from 13th place Felix Neureuther. Starting in reverse order in the second run, Neureuther briefly led, but the best time of the second run came from Kjetil Jansrud in 1:20.15, starting in 11th position. Jansrud then had an anxious wait as the leaders came down. When Svindal came to take his second run, his combined time of 2:38.44 was not good enough to overtake his compatriot. Baumann then made mistakes, and finished only fifth. With a lead of 0.80 seconds over Jansrud, Janka skied well enough to finish with a combined time of 2:37.83, defeating Jansrud by 0.39 seconds to take the gold medal.
From the first six finishers five used Atomic skis, while only fifth placed Baumann was on Salomon. Two notable skiers lower down the order â Dow Travers, finishing 69th, and Muhammad Abbas finishing 79th â were the first ever competitors in a Winter Olympics from the Cayman Islands and Pakistan, respectively.

The course loacted in the Rosa Khutor Alpine Center started at an altitude of 1,365 metres on a separate slope and after halfway, at the âSerpentineâ passage, and then followed the lower part of the downhill course to the finish area. The terrain was described as easy, which could presage a close race. The five World Cup giant slaloms of the season underway saw five different winners with Lara Gut (SÃ¶lden), Jessica Lindell-Vikarby (Beaver Creek), Tessa Worley (St. Moritz), Tina Weirather (Val dâIsÃ¨re), and Anna Fenninger (Lienz), who also represented five different nations. The current World Cup standing was topped by Lindell-Vikarby in front of PietilÃ¤-Holmner, Weirather, and Fenninger. The 2010 gold medalist Viktoria Rebensburg also won the giant slalom World Cup in 2010/11 and 2011/12, while Vancouver silver medalist Tina Maze was 2011 World champion and won the giant slalom World Cup in 2012/13. The reigning World champion from 2013 was Worley, but she missed the Games after tearing her right ACL shortly before Christmas in the World Cup slalom in Courchevel only two days after her win in St. Moritz.
As in 2010 weather conditions were influential in determining the outcome of this race, with snow at the top of the course turning to rain at the bottom. In the first run this favored the early skiers. First to go was Tina Maze (SLO), who set what proved to be the fastest time of 1:17.88. Behind her was the next starter Jessica Lindell-Vikarby (SWE) who was 0.52 seconds behind. As skiers struggled with the conditions, Anna Fenninger (AUT) posted a good time of 1:18.73, followed by the young American skier Mikaela Shiffrin with a time of 1:18.79. Defending champion Viktoria Rebensberg (GER) came next, but was some 1.36 seconds off the pace of Maze. Only Nadia Fanchini (ITA) was able to threaten the leader, posting a time of 1:18.53 to finish in third place at the end of the first run.
With the top 30 going in reverse order, Rebensberg was to take the lead, her run of 1:17.90 proving to be the fastest second run, and a combined time of 2:37.14 setting the target. Shiffrin could not improve on this and finished 0.23 seconds behind the leader. However Fenninger was to take over the lead with the third fastest second run, setting a new target of 2:36.94. Fanchini was unable to defeat either of the two leading times and Lindell-Vikarby did not have a good second run, putting her down to seventh place. Going last Maze had a relatively slow run (11th fastest), but had enough in hand over Fenninger to hang on and win her second gold medal by 0.07 seconds. The second fastest in the second run was Lara Gut (SUI), but a poor first run cost her any chance of a medal and she finished in ninth place.
With her second gold at this Games Maze become the most sucessful Alpine skier in Sochi. She also won a second gold medal for skiing manufacturer StÃ¶ckli, while Fenninger used Head and Rebensburg won the sole medal at this Games for Nordica, with bronze. Six different nations placed in the top six and all also used different skis. Finishing in 55th place Alessia Afi Dipol became the first Alpine skiing competitor for Togo, only five days after Mathilde Amivi Petitjean represented this country for the first time in Winter Olympics. Back in 65th position Elise Pellegrin was the first ever Winter Olympic competitor from Malta and in 67th place was Vanessa Vanakorn, the first Alpine skier from Thailand. She was much better known as Vanessa-Mae, world famous violinist, who was reported to have sold over 10 million albums. Having dual nationality (British and Thai) she elected to ski for Thailand under her father name.

Finishing only 11th, she came back on the second run with the third best time but it only moved her up to seventh overall. The first run was led by American Christin Cooper, who was a top international skier, having won silver medals in slalom and GS at the 1982 World Championships, but she was not the best American, that title going to Tamara McKinney, the 1983 overall World Cup winner. McKinney also struggled on the first run, placing eighth, coming back to win the second run, but falling just short of the medals in fourth place. The runner-up on the first run was another American, this one a much bigger surprise, as Debbie Armstrong had only one podium finish in her first year on the World Cup circuit, a third in a super-G a few weeks before the Olympics. On the second run, the happy-go-lucky Armstrong was determined to enjoy herself and simply have fun in what for her was an unknown situation. She placed fourth on the second run, but when Cooper almost missed the fifth gate, costing her time which eventually placed her seventh on the second run, the gold medal was Armstrong.
Cooper and Armstrong later repaid the citizens of Sarajevo who had treated them so well. Cooper co-founded Humanitarian Olympians for Peace, which aided the later to be war-torn Bosnian capital with lifts of tons of winter clothing and sports equipment. Armstrong helped found Global ReLeaf Sarajevo, which helps to re-forest the devastated regions around Sarajevo.

Originally scheduled for 12 February, the race was postponed to the 15th due to strong winds, which would have made the giant slalom follow the slalom, originally scheduled for the 14th, but the slalom was also postponed.
The giant slalom World Cup season saw Viktoria Rebensburg, the bronze medalist from Sochi and silver medalist at the 2015 World Championships, in the lead. She was followed by Tessa Worley, who won the last race before the Olympics in Lenzerheide and was also the giant slalom Crystal Globe winner from the last season (2016/17) as well as the reigning World Champion. In third place was the runner-up in giant slalom at the 2017 World Championships, Mikaela Shiffrin. Considered contenders were Federica Brignone, who already won one race this season, and Ragnhild Mowinckel. The gold medalist from Sochi, Tina Maze, had already retired, while the silver medalist Anna Veith, who won the giant slalom World Cup in 2013/14 and 2014/15 and was also the 2015 World Champion, was returning after surgeries on both knees. The 2015/16 World Cup champion Eva-Maria Brem failed to qualify for the Games after breaking her left tibia and fibula in a November 2016 crash.
The race started under sunny, but cold conditions, -9Â° C. at the start. Manuela MÃ¶lgg led off and surprisingly no one was able to beat her time of 1:10.62. Next to her was Shiffrin in second, Brignone in third and Mowinckel in fourth position with the first nine athletes within a second. Rebensburg was only in eighth and Worley down in 14th, a full 1.42 seconds behind MÃ¶lgg. In the second run Estelle Alphand, who started early, set the fastest run time with Worley only 1/100th of a second behind, but neither got near the medals because of their weak first runs. The win went to the world dominant skier, Mikaela Shiffrin, with Mowickel in second and Brignone in third. The leader after the first run, MÃ¶lgg, who never won a World Cup race, dropped down to eighth place.
Mowinckel also made history in becoming the first ever Norwegian woman to win a medal in giant slalom, which was only the second Alpine skiing medal for Norwegian women after a bronze medal won in combined by Laila Schou Nilsen, back in 1936.

Due to the postponement of the men downhill, the event was held on the same day, with the starting times adjusted so as not to clash with the men.
Three racers shared the wins in the six events held in the ongoing giant slalom World Cup, with Mikaela Shiffrin winning the first two races, in SÃ¶lden and Courchevel 1, while Tessa Worley won in Lienz, and Sara Hector in Courchevel 2, and also the last two races before the Games, in Kranjska Gora, and Kronzplatz. Hector also led the World Cup standings followed by Worley and Shiffrin.
The Crystal Globes in this event had been won by Viktoria Rebensburg (2018), who had retired in 2020, Mikaela Shiffrin (2019), Federica Brignone (2020), and Marta Bassino (2021), but the last two World Championships had been won by Petra VlhovÃ¡ (2019) and Lara Gut-Behrami (2021). During the current season Gut-Behrami contested only two of the six races also because of a COVID-19 illness. Shiffrin was also the gold medallist from PyeongChang, with Mowinckel winning silver and Brignone taking bronze.
Skiers from 49 different nations started the race, which was a record for female Alpine skiing events. The race was started by VlhovÃ¡ but she was soon overtaken by the next racer, Michelle Gisin. Brignone started next and bettered Gisin time by 1.21 seconds. Worley wearing bib number 4 was not able to reach Brignone, being 0.95 seconds behind. After Bassino did not finish her run, it was Hector who took the lead by 42/100ths of a second. As Shiffrin was also not able to finish the race, others took their chance with Katharina Truppe surprisingly finishing in second place, only 3/10ths behind Hector, and also Meta Hrovat (fourth), Ragnhild Mowinckel (fifth), and Nina OâBrien (sixth) bringing themselves into the top positions.
On the second run Coralie Frasse Sombet, who was 26th on the first run, set the early pace with what was finally the third best time of the second run, to finish 17th overall. VlhovÃ¡, only 13th after the first run, was not in contention and did not improve on the second run, finishing 14th overall. The second-best time on run two brought Thea Stjernesund down from 15th after run one, to a final sixth place. The best run time was set by Gut-Behrami, which was good enough for bronze as, of those in the top three after the first run, only Truppe dropped to an unfortunate fourth place, 0.08 seconds away from bronze. Brignone took silver while Hector brought down her lead to win Sweden first gold medal in this event since Pernilla Wiberg back in 1992. Hector (gold) and Gut-Behrami (bronze) used Head skis, while Brignone (silver) raced Rossignol and Truppe (fourth) Fischer.
After Shiffrin did not finish the first run, the second run cased more back luck for Team USA as OâBrien endured troubles shortly before the finish line. She crashed into the last gate and badly fell into the finish area. After several minutes of first-aid she was transported to hospital where she was treated for an open left tibia and fibula fracture.
Finishing 38th in this event was Aruwin Salehhuddin, who became the first ever female Winter Olympics competitor for Malaysia, and the last finisher Kiana Kryeziu achieved the same claim for her country Kosovo. Sarah Escobar was the first ever Winter Olympian from Ecuador, while Noa SzÅllÅs and Gwyneth Ten Raa became the first ever female Alpine skier for Israel and Luxembourg, respectively.

Peters won one of the bronze medals, while the other went to Dutch judoka Henk Grol, who had won a bronze at Beijing in this class and was World silver medalist in 2010.

Naidangiin was almost unknown, his international record consisting only of fifth-place finishes in heavyweight and open class at the 2006 Asian Games. Naidangiin had surprised from the start, upsetting Japan Keiji Suzuki in the first round. Suzuki was the defending Olympic Champion and had been World Champion in 2005.

Born an ethnic Albanian in Kosovo, when it was still part of Serbia, she had to compete for Albania in 2012. Alhough still not recognized by many countries after declaring independence, the NOC of Kosovo was acknowledged by the IOC in 2014. This paved the way for Kelmendi to compete for her home country. Her gold medal was Kosovo first Olympic medal of any colour.
Early in the competition, she met Christianne Legentil from Mauritius, to whom she had lost in 2012. Again she had to struggle, but eventually defeated the African on penalties. In the semi-final Kelmendi had another tough fight, when she edged out three-time World Champion Misato Nakamura by just one penalty. In the final against Italy Odette Giuffrida she scored a Yuko after 29 seconds, which was enough to clinch the gold. Giuffrida silver came as a bigger surprise than Kelmendi gold. Her only previous international medal was a bronze at the 2015 European Games, but she advanced to the Rio final after defeating the top ranked Romanian Andreea ChiÈu. As at Beijing in 2008, Nakamura had to take consolation with a bronze medal alongside Russian Nataliya Kuzyutina. In the elimination round, Nakamura defeated Kuzyutina in the longest bout with an Ippon (full point) 3:39 minutes into the Golden Score period.
Allegations were raised that Joud Fahmy of Saudi Arabia deliberately forfeited her first-round match against Legentil to avoid meeting Israeli Gili Cohen in the second round. These were rejected by Saudi Arabian officials stating that Fahmy was injured and advised by medical staff not to compete.

Second seed Uta Abe from Japan was considered favourite on home soil in the final against the top seeded Frenchwoman Amandine Buchard. Abe had been world champion in 2018 and 2019 and succeeded in four Grand Slam tournaments in the last four years. Buchard, however, had clinched the European title, won the World Masters in 2021, and had already defeated Abe on the World Judo Tour. In the final, after 8:27 min, and well into the extra-time, the Japanese pinned Buchard with a Kuzure-kesa-gatame for an Ippon (full point) as Golden Score. Abe had a tough path into the final and beat the two eventual bronze medallists, Odette Giuffrida, Italy silver medallist in 2016, and Britain Chelsie Giles, the only highly seeded participant with no World or European Championships medal to her credit. Against Giuffrida, Abe required more than seven minutes for a Golden Score. Buchard sailed through the first three rounds with convincing victories by Ippon including a 16 seconds flash victory over Switzerland Fabienne Kocher.
Although dominant in the bout, Kocher later missed the first Judo medal for Switzerland in succumbing Giles, who scored two Waza-aris (half points) to take bronze. Giuffrida toppled Hungarian Reka Pupp by Seoi-nage for an Ippon after 4:31. In the first round, Pupp eliminated Majlinda Kelmendi from Kosovo, sending her home after just one match. Only seeded 15th, the 2016 gold medallist was not considered a potential medallist in Tokyo although she had placed third at the 2021 World Masters in Doha.
Abe won her gold medal about half an hour before her brother Hifume won gold in the same weight category in the men events. Thus, they accomplished the same historical feat as in the 2018 World Championships, when they clinched the titles as the first brother and sister to do so.

The two top athletes in this division had already met in the finals of the European and World Championships with Trstenjak winning the most recent bout.

For the second bronze medal, third-seeded Miku Tashiro from Japan faced Israel fourth-seeded Yarden Gerbi. Gerbi victory by Waza-ari gave Israel its first medal in the Rio Games and made this event the first without a medal for Japan.

In his first run in the final he scored 46.8 (out of 50) to lead comfortably over Scotty Lago (USA) with 42.8 and Swiss rider Iouri Podladtchikov, who had competed at Torino for Russia, and had recently been second to White at the Winter X Games with 42.4 points. Many of the competitors had ambitious programs for their second run, but most failed to complete their runs without serious error. One exception was Peetu Piiroinen (FIN), runner-up at the 2009 US Open, who exceeded his 40.8 first run score with a run worth 45.0 points that moved him into second place. By the time White was to start his second run, he was already assured of the gold medal, and thrilled the crowd by putting in his trademark Double McTwist movement for an outstanding score of 48.4 points.

Their biggest rival was expected to be China Lia Jiayu, who had come out of nowhere in 2009 to win the World Championships and lead the World Cup standings at only 16-years-old. But also to be considered was Australian Torah Bright, the Burton US Open Champion in 2006, 2008, and 2009.
Bright was the leading competitor in the qualifying round, scoring 41.3 and 45.8 on her two runs. She was followed by Clark with 45.4, Spain Queralt Castellet on 44.3 and reigning Olympic champion Teter with 42.7. Teter led after the first run in the final with a score of 42.4, ahead of Liu and France Sophie Rodriguez. Of the other top qualifiers, both Bright and Clark had fallen and posted low scores, and Castellet was unable to start because of injury. In the second run, both Bright and Clark improved their marks considerably, Bright scoring 45.0 and Clark 42.2 to take the gold and bronze medals. Although Teter put in another good performance on her second run, her score of 39.2 did not better her first run, and she settled for a silver medal.

Burke had died in January 2012 after a training accident in which she fell on her head at the Park City, Utah superpipe. She died nine days later from the effects of her head injury. In her memory, the skiiers tried to wear black armbands but the International Olympic Committee, in a petty ruling, would not allow that. Burke coach, Trennon Paynter did something better, spreading her ashes over the halfpipe course where they remain in the snow of Sochi as a tribute.
In Burke absence the favorite was American Maddie Bowman, who had won the superpipe at the last two Winter X-Games. Bowman came through under the pressure and won the inaugural freestyle halfpipe gold medal, followed by France Marie Martinod. Martinod was a 29-year-old mother of one who had been retired for several years until Burke called her to tell her that halfpipe was going to be an Olympic event. She had come out retirement to compete, though her performance made it hard to tell she had ever been away. The bronze went to Japan Ayana Onozuka who held the same spot at the 2013 World Championships.

In the final, Flanagan improved on his last throw to 170-41/4 (51.92) to repeat his victories of 1900 and 1904.  Flanagan commented on his victory 20 years later, )It was, without doubt, one of the most satisfying competition wins of my life.  Matt McGrath tended to be a little arrogant and I had the feeling he believed he was certain to win.  When it all came down to my last throw I knew I had to put everything into it and as it turned out I did.  If I have any regret at all now, it is that I was not competing for Ireland on that day.)
John Flanagan had won the Olympic title in 1900 and 1904 and was then considered the greatest hammer thrower of the 20th century.  He set 18 marks considered as world records between 1896 and 1909.  Flanagan would win seven AAU hammer championships and six titles with the 56-lb. weight.  Of Irish birth (Kilbreedy, County Limerick), he had emigrated to the United States in 1897.  Amazingly for a man of his size (5â10â [1.78 metres], 220 lbs. [100 kg.]), he finished second in both the high and long jump and the all-around at the 1895 Irish Championships.
By 1908, Matt McGrath (USA) was becoming Flanagan rival for hammer throw supremacy.  He first appeared on the national scene in 1907, finishing 2nd in the AAU championship, but he was a world-class hammer thrower until 1928, winning seven AAU titles (the last in 1926), setting two world records, and winning three Olympic medals - silvers in 1908 and 1924, and a gold in 1912.  In his defense, it was noted that he had injured his knee in the spring of 1908 and was not fully recovered from that by the time of the Olympics.
Interestingly, all three medal winners were born in Ireland and with Scotsman, Tom Nicolson, finishing in fourth place, it was a memorable day for Celtic throwers.  The bronze medalist, Con Walsh, had been born in Carriganimma, County Cork, but spent most of his athletic career in Canada, and may have had the most potential of any of the throwers.  The 1920 Olympic hammer champion, Paddy Ryan (USA), commented on Walsh in a 1958 interview, )Con liked the good life and as far as he was concerned training was not part of the good life.  He could have beaten the lot of us but he never bothered with any serious training.  He was lazy but thoroughly enjoyed competition and was a wonderful man to know at all times.)

For Flanagan, it was the first of three consecutive Olympic titles in the event, a mark only surpassed in athletics by Al Oerter in the discus and Carl Lewis in the long jump.

They had originally wanted to demonstrate rugby, but this turned out to be impossible. For the handball match, the finalists of the 1948 world championships, Sweden and Denmark, were invited. Sweden had also finished second at the 1952 championships, which were held briefly before the Olympics. In rainy conditions, in front of a poorly filled Olympic Stadium, the Swedes defeated the Danes, 19-11. The demonstration did not help to bring back handball as an Olympic sport soon; it would only return 20 years later at the Munich Olympics.

Teddy Riner, the country flagbearer during the Opening Ceremony and one of the heavy favorites, successfully defended his gold medal from London. The 2.04 m tall, almost 140 kg giant, continued his winning streak at European and World Championships, as well as Olympic Games, because his last major defeat was in the final of the 2010 World Championships. In the quarter-final in Rio, Riner opposed the home favorite Rafael da Silva. Although Silva received three penalties, he survived the regular period of five minutes but was eventually defeated by a Waza-ari (half point) by Riner. In the semi-final, Riner had to once more go the full distance against Israel Or Sasson, again winning by a Waza-ari with Sumi-gaeshi (corner throw) in the last second.
The other half of the draw was dominated by Japan Hisayoshi Harasawa. After a difficult start in his first bout, he dominated his remaining opponents , winning the next three fights by Ippon (full point). The final was between the two dominant judokas in this division, Riner and Harasawa, but the gold medal was finally decided based on Shidos (penalties), with two given to Harasawa early in the bout and one to Riner half a minute from the final bell. This was enough for Riner to clinch the gold, leaving silver for Harasawa. The bronze medals went to two of Riner victims, Rafael Silva and Or Sasson.
In his first contest of the day, Sasson met Egypt Islam El-Shehaby, a fixture overshadowed by political issues. When the Israeli won by Ippon, El-Shehaby refused to shake hands or bow, the normal gesture of appreciation after any encounter in judo. Consequently, the Egyptian was booed by the crowd. Allegedly, he had been under pressure by nationalists and Islamists not to compete at all.

His challengers were felt to be the Canadian Doug Rogers, who had trained with Inokuma in Japan, and the Soviet Georgian, Anzor Kâikânadze, who had almost defeated Inokuma in 1961, using sambo armlock techniques. There were five pools. Inokuma, Rogers, and Kâikânadze all won their pools comfortably, as did Kim Jong-Dai of Korea. Inokuma and Kim faced off in the only knock-out (quarter-final) match. Inokuma put Kim to the mat and held him down until Kim tapped submission, which was almost unheard of in that era. Rogers faced the second Soviet, Parnaoz Chikâviladze, in the first semi-final, with Rogers winning with yusei-gachi. In the second semi-final, Inokuma remembered his near defeat to Kâikânadze and took no chances of allowing him to get his armlock hold. He threw Kâikânadze with tai-otoshi at the five-minute mark and won the match to advance to the final against Rogers. The final was a dull affair, with little wrestling occurring for the first 10 minutes. The referee, Charles Palmer (GBR), warned both judoka, and threatened to disqualify both with neither getting a medal. The pace quickened a little, but not much. Inokuma was given the decision for greater aggressiveness although the result was formally termed kinsa.

Bradford and Vlasov tied in the press with 180.0 kg, with Schemansky at 170.0 kg. Everyone else was well behind and the medals were settled if all three made a lift in the remaining two phases.

Vlasov returned in 1964 at Tokyo where he was upset by his teammate, Leonid Zhabotinsky.

Bulgaria had already had three of their lifters in Sydney test positive at doping controls, and the weightlifting team was seemingly expelled from the 2000 Olympics. However, Bulgaria paid the International Weightlifting Federation a âfineâ (or bribe) of $50,000 and Tsagaev was allowed to compete by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Said Saif was one of eight Bulgarian weightlifters who transferred allegiance to Qatar in 1999 for a reported transfer fee of $1,000,000, with the lifters also paid by the Qataris. Popov/Said Saif was the only Bulqatarian to win a medal in Sydney.

Ties broken by lightest bodyweight.,na,"After finishing 4th at the 2012 Olympic Games in London, Uzbekistan`s Ruslan Nurudinov was enroute to dominating the Olympic cycle prior to the 2016 Rio Olympic Games. He won the 2013 World Championships, and captured the silver in 2014, after briefly setting a world record in the clean & jerk (when Ilya Ilyin of Kazahkstan re-set it by three kilograms, and beat him on body weight). When Nurudinov missed the 2015 World Championships with a knee injury, the Kazahk Aleksandr Zaychikov took the World title.  With their main rival Ilyin (the four-time World champion, and originally a double Olympic champion from 2008 and 2012), now banned and officially stripped of both his gold medals due to doping infractions, the competition was between Nurudinov and Zaychikov. Also a potential to get on the podium was Armenian Simon Martirosyan, who won the 2014 Youth Olympic Games (in the 85 kg class), and the 2016 World Junior Championships (in the light-superweight, 105+kg, class) with a 412 kg total.
In Rio, Nurudinov and fellow Uzbek lifter Ivan Yefremov were tied at 194 kg after the snatch, but Yefremov heaviest clean & jerk topped out at 220 kg for the day. Martirosyan had a chance to move ahead of Nurudinov but failed his last clean & jerk at 234 kg.  Nurudinov, age 24, having already secured the gold medal with his second-last clean &jerk, elected to take his third lift to break the existing Olympic record of 236 kg, with a final 237 kg effort and finish with a total of 431 kg winning Uzbekistan first Olympic medal in the sport and sending the crowd into a frenzy. Still a teenager, Martirosyan, captured the silver medal to become Armenia first medal winner at the Rio Games, and dedicated his medal to the people of Armenia. Zaychikov only made his opening clean & jerk, but it was good enough for the bronze medal.
Kiribati David Katoatau, the 2014 Commonwealth Games champion, who finished 14th in Rio, entertained the crowd with dances after each lift, as part of his attempt to bring attention to the threat climate change poses to his homeland, and other low-lying Pacific islands, and was pleading for international support to preserve Kiribati.

Ties broken by lightest bodyweight.,na,"In the men heavyweight weightlifting event at the 2012 Summer Olympics, three potential favorites withdrew from the competition before it even began. Andrey Aryamnov, the defending Olympic champion who held all but one of the world and Olympic records, suffered an injury to his thigh during the season and bowed out of defending his title. Defending World and 2011 European Champion Khadzhimurat Akkayev of Russia, a former competitor in the middle-heavyweight class who had won silver and bronze at the 2004 and 2008 Olympics respectively, was on the start list, but dropped out with a sore back. The same fate befell his compatriot Dmitry Klokov, 2008 silver medalist, 2005 World Champion, and 2010 and 2011 runner-up, among other accolades. These withdrawals left Marcin DoÅÄga of Poland, three times World Champion (2006, 2009, and 2010) as the runaway favorite.
There were more surprises in the snatch competition, when DoÅÄga failed to lift 190 kg in three attempts and was eliminated. Had he been successful, he would have finished this part of the event in first, as only his compatriot BartÅomiej Bonk, 2011 European bronze medalist, was able to lift that weight and, because he had a higher body weight than DoÅÄga, would have been ranked lower. The next highest lift was 185 kg and it was achieved by three competitors, including Oleksiy Torokhtiy of Ukraine, 2011 world bronze medalist. In the clean and jerk portion, Bonk failed in his first attempt at 219 kg, but made 220 kg in his second lift and went into first place with a six point lead. Navab Nasirshelal of Iran, bronze medalist at the 2009 Asian Championships, and Torokhtiy then both entered with successful lifts of 222 kg, putting them in third and second place respectively. Bonk, along with three others, then failed to lift 225 kg, setting the bar for gold at 410 points. The Ukrainian attempted a 226 kg lift, which would have put him in the lead with 411 points, but failed, giving Nasirshelal a chance to reach the same mark with a 227 kg lift. The Iranian succeeded and leaped into gold medal position, but Torokhtiy matched the lift and moved into first place with a score of 412.  When Nasirshelal was unable to respond with the necessary 229 kg lift, Torokhtiy took the gold in a score that was notably low for the division; in the three previous editions of the Games, 412 would not have been sufficient for even a bronze medal.
And that was how the results stood until December 2019, when the IOC announced that Oleksiy Torokhtiy was disqualified after a re-test of his samples, when the re-test showed metabolites of dehydrochloromethyltestosterone (Turinabol). In late November 2020, the medals in this event were re-assigned, respectively, to Nassirshalal, Bonk, and Ivan Yefremov (UZB).

The favorite was Belarussian Andrey Aryamnov who had won the 2007 World Championships. He won easily, breaking world records in the snatch, clean & jerk, and total. Russia won the silver and bronze medal, with Dmitry Klokov taking silver and Dmitry Lapikov the bronze. Ukrainian Ihor Razoronov originally placed sixth, but was disqualified when his doping test came back positive for nandrolone, an anabolic steroid. Of the original top nine, the only non-Soviet Republic lifters were Poland Marcin DoÅÄga, who placed fourth, and his brother, Robert DoÅÄga, who placed eighth after the Razoronov disqualification.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected.

The best qualifier was Simon Martirosyan, the world record holder in total with 435 kg. He was also the 2018 and 2019 world champion, and 2019 European champion, but he missed a valid attempt in clean & jerk at the European Championships in April 2021 and was placed last. The season best lifter was Ruslan Nurudinov, who won the Asian championships in April 2021 with a new world record in clean & jerk (241 kg) and a total of 429 kg. After his samples from the 2012 London Games had been re-tested, they revealed doping and he was suspended for two years from December 2018. He was therefore prevented from qualifying for Tokyo as it was required to compete in at least one event in each of the three qualifying periods. As Yang Zhe was not selected for the Chinese team, because only four male athletes per nation were allowed to compete, it meant the world record holder in snatch with 200 kg, achieved at the Asian championships in April 2021, was also not present in Tokyo. This meant Akbar Djuraev was the season best qualifier with 428 kg, set on the way to winning silver at the last Asian championships. Behind Martirosyan and Djuraev, the field was wide open as numerous athletes had performed on almost the same level. They were Timur Naniyev, the only male weightlifter for the Russian Olympic Committee competing in Tokyo, with a qualification best of 409 kg, Hristo Hristov, season best 406 kg, or Ali Hashemi and ArtÅ«rs PlÄsnieks, both with qualification bests of 405 kg.
The snatch element did not create any surprises as Martirosyan lifted 195 kg and Djuraev 193 kg, followed by Hristov 189 kg, Naniyev 188 kg, and Hashemi 184 kg, while PlÄsnieks and Jin Yun-Seong cleared 180 kg. These results indicated what was to come in the rest of the competition. As expected, the clean & jerk element was also close for all three medal positions from early on. Hristov lifted 219 kg in his second attempt, while Naniyev lifted 221 kg and PlÄsnieks cleared 225 kg in their second lifts, which gave Naniyev the lead with 409 kg, followed by Hristov on 408 kg and PlÄsnieks on 405 kg. Naniyev, Hristov, and Jin all failed to improve their totals while Hashemi failed to clear any weight, but PlÄsnieks came from behind and lifted a personal best 230 kg for a total of 410 kg to get into the bronze medal position. The race for gold was started by Djuraev who cleared 227 kg with his first attempt, which was answered with a 228 kg by Martirosyan. After Djuraev failed to lift 234 kg, Martirosyan tried to put pressure on the young Uzbek as he increased the weight so that Djuraev had to lift again immediately, but this went wrong when Djuraev cleared 237 kg in his last attempt. Martirosyan had to go for 238 kg, three kilograms more than needed for gold, but he failed both lifts and won a second successive silver medal.
The Olympic Standard for Olympic records was 193 kg for snatch, 231 kg for clean & jerk, and 419 kg for total. Martirosyan set an Olympic record in snatch with 195 kg while Djuraev set a record in clean & jerk with 237 kg and he then set the in total record with 420 kg, until bettered by Martirosyan with 423 kg, but Djuraev got it back after lifting 430 kg.

Defending Olympic champion Svetlana Podobedova of Kazakhstan, the most recent World bronze medalist, had also tested positive for banned substances and would lose her gold medal a few months later. Meanwhile China Kang Yue, the reigning World champion and 2013 and 2014 runner-up, floundered at the National Championships and was not selected for Rio. This left Rim Jong-Sim of North Korea as the favorite: she was the 2012 Olympic champion in the light-heavyweight division, but had taken bronze in 2014 and silver in 2015 at the Worlds in the heavyweight category. The only other recent World Championship medalist was Spain Lidia ValentÃ­n (bronze in 2013), who was also the 2014 and 2015 European champion and the 2013 runner-up. ValentÃ­n was a two-time Olympic veteran who finished fifth in 2008 and fourth in 2012, but was bumped up to the silver and gold medal positions respectively following a series of doping-related disqualifications. The reigning European champion was Iryna Dekha of Ukraine, while France GaÃ«lle Nayo-Ketchanke was the 2015 and 2016 runner-up.
Rim took a significant lead in the snatch portion with a lift of 121 kg. Trailing behind were ValentÃ­n and Belarusâ Darya Naumava at 116 kg and Dekha at 114 kg. In her first attempt at the clean and jerk, Rim lifted 145 kg, which was not only 9 more than anyone else in the opening round, but 3 more than any other competitor would lift in the entire competition. She secured her gold medal by lifting 153 kg in her next attempt and used her final lift to try and improve on the Olympic record, but failed. ValentÃ­n and Naumava, meanwhile, battled for silver, with the Belarusian coming out on top by 1 kg each round. Dekha, the only other competitor reasonably in contention for a podium spot, struggled in the clean and jerk and placed fifth overall, giving ValentÃ­n the bronze.

Ties broken by lightest bodyweight.,na,"There was no easy way to pick a favorite in the women heavyweight division of the weightlifting tournament at the 2012 Summer Olympics, which had three strong competitors vying for the crown. Nadezhda Yevstyukhina of Russia, holding the world record in the clean and jerk, was probably the most prominent among them, having won bronze at the 2008 Games and the 2007 and 2010 World Championships, silver at the 2006 World Championships and 2010 European Championships, and gold at the 2011 World and European Championships. Her compatriot Nataliya Zabolotnaya held the world record in the snatch and total points and had silver medals from the 2004 Olympics, the 2005, 2007, and 2010 World Championships, and the 2011 European Championships, along with five European titles (2003, 2006, 2008-2010). Finally there was Svetlana Podobedova of Kazakhstan, formerly of Russia, who had World Championship bronze from 2005, silver from 2011, and gold from 2004, 2005, 2009, and 2010 in addition to the 2010 Asian Games title.
After Yevstyukhina failed three times to snatch 125 kg, the remainder of the event became a ferocious exchange between Podobedova and Zabolotnaya that resulted in eight Olympic records being set of the course of competition. The Kazakh beat the old Olympic record in the snatch by 2 kilograms with a 130 kg lift, but was immediately overtaken by Zabolotnaya, who lifted 131 kg. No other competitor came close to this weight; Irina Kulesha of Belarus, who had a long history of finishing fourth that included the 2008 Olympics and the most recent two World Championships, was third with 121 kg. In the next phase, Zabolotnaya lifted 155 kg to set an Olympic record in the clean and jerk and total points, but Podobedova responded by lifting 156 kg. Zabolotnaya again reset both records, this time with a 160 kg lift, but Podobedova bested her again with a 161 kg lift. Their scores tied at the end, the Kazakh became Olympic champion by 0.22 kilograms, the difference in their weight in a tie-breaker where the lightest competitor would win. Kulesha finished in a distant third place, twenty-two kg behind the front runners, but finally on the podium.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected. Every women weightlifting event at the 2012 London Olympics, except flyweight (â¤ 48 kg), was affected by positive re-tests.
All three medalists in this event ended up disqualified for positive re-tests. Svetlana Podobedova (KAZ) tested positive for stanozolol in October 2016, while Nataliya Zabolotnaya (RUS) and Irina Kulesha (BLR) had re-test positives for turinabol (dehydrochloromethyltestosterone) announced on 21 November 2016. The medals were re-assigned as follows: Gold â Lydia ValentÃ­n (ESP); Silver â Abir Abdulrahman (EGY); Bronze â Madias Nzesso (CMR). ValentÃ­n received her gold medal on 28 February 2019 at a special ceremony in Madrid.
ValentÃ­n especially benefited from the plethora of drug re-tests at the 2008-12 Olympics, having been moved up to a silver medal in this event in 2008. Kulesha also had a re-test positive for turinabol at this event at the 2008 Olympics. ValentÃ­n won a bronze medal in the event in 2016, without medal re-assignments, so, technically, âshe won her third Olympic medal before she won her first two,â if that makes any sense.

The heavy favourite in the heavyweight category was Wang Zhouyu, season best 286 kg, who was the reigning world champion from 2019 and back-to-back winner of the last two Asian championships in 2019 and 2020 (held in 2021). The next best performances, but a long way behind Zhouyu, were from compatriots Kang Yue, second at the last Asian championships with 273 kg, and Ao Hui, world champion in 2018 with 268 kg, and Kim Un-Ju (PRK), runner-up at the last two World championships with a qualification best of 269 kg. None of those three, however, participated in Tokyo. The two Chinese lifters were prevented from competing because of the one nation per event rule, and Kim did not take part because PRK decided not to send a team to the Olympics due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The next best qualifiers were Tamara Salazar, season best 260 kg and bronze medallist at the last World Championships, MarÃ­a ValdÃ©s, qualification best 259 kg, and Crismery Santana, season best 258 kg. ValdÃ©s had to withdraw shortly before the Games due to a shoulder injury.
Wang won the competition easily to give China their sixth weightlifting gold medal of the Games. She lifted 120 kg in snatch and 150 kg in clean & jerk for a total of 270 kg. Silver went to Salazar who enjoyed a perfect competition, and was the only lifter to successfully lift all six attempts with her best being 113 kg in snatch, and 150 kg in clean & jerk for a total of 263 kg. Bronze went to Santana while MÃ¶nkhjantsangiin Ankhtsetseg finished fourth for the best ever weightlifting result for Mongolia. She had already finished fourth in the 2014 Youth Olympics and qualified for Tokyo only after Valeria Rivas was cut from the Colombian squad when their federation was sanctioned due to the high number of doping offences.
The Olympic Standard for Olympic records was 130 kg for snatch, 159 kg for clean & jerk, and 289 kg for total. None of these records were broken, which was not a surprise as none of the world standards had ever been broken. Wang tried to lift 160 kg in her last attempt to set at least an Olympic record in clean & jerk and total but failed to clear the weight.

Akoyev was considered a co-favorite with Bulgarian Stefan Botev, the 1989-90 World Champion. Botev no longer wanted to represent Bulgaria as he had emigrated to Australia. However the Bulgarian weightlifting officials would not release Botev to compete for Australia and demanded that he compete at the 1992 Olympics for his native country. The same held true for Nicu Vlad, a Romanian who had won the 1984 Olympic middle-heavyweight gold medal and had also recently emigrated to Australia. He also could not get a release and competed in Barcelona for Romania. Vlad also wanted to compete as a heavyweight I but his qualifying mark had come in the heavyweight II class and he was forced to compete in this class, giving up 5 kg of bodyweight to his competitors.
Akoyev led the competition with 195.0 kg after the snatch, followed by Weller with 192.5 kg and Botev and Vlad with 190.0 kg.

Competitors losing to the finalists entered repechage tournament for bronze medals.,na,"In the inaugural women heavyweight freestyle wrestling event at the 2004 Summer Olympics Stanka Zlateva of Bulgaria finished last. By the 2012 Games she had five of the last six World Championship titles (2006-2011 except 2009), all the European Championships over the same period except for the most recent one, an Olympic silver medal from 2008, and was considered the overwhelming favorite for the crown in London. There were several secondary favorites in the tournament, including Wang Jiao, the defending Olympic Champion who had pinned Zlateva in the finals of the Beijing Games, but Wang had been unable to maintain this form on the international scene. Unlike in the other divisions, Japan was not considered a major threat for the crown as their entrant, Kyoko Hamaguchi, was already 34 and had a weak showing at the most recent World Championships. Still, with 10 medals from the World Championships stretching back to 1997, half of them gold, she could not be counted out.
With Zlateva and Wang ending up in opposite halves of the draw, many observers expected a rematch of the 2008 Olympic final. Wang was pinned in the semi-finals, however, by Russia Nataliya Vorobyova, whose best finish at a major international competition was third at the most recent European Championships. Vorobyova had also pinned Gyuzel Manyurova of Kazakhstan, the silver medalist from the 2004 Games, in the quarterfinals, who had in turn defeated Hamaguchi. In the final it seemed at first that Zlateva had the advantage, able to counter Vorobyova aggression and speed with raw strength and pushing the Russian out of the ring for a one point victory in the first period. Like a recurring nightmare, however, Zlateva found herself again pinned in an Olympic final, losing the gold medal by a fall for the second time. This gave Vorobyova the outstanding distinction of having pinned an Olympic champion and two Olympic runners-up in an Olympic tournament without ever having won a World Championships medal.
Having both been pinned by the eventual gold medalist, Manyurova and Wang met in the first bronze medal match in a rematch of the final from the 2011 Asian Championships, where the Kazakh had emerged victorious. They fought ferociously, each scoring one point in the first round, which was given to the Chinese competitor for having scored last. Wang pushed her opponent out of the ring in the second period and was leading the round until the final five seconds, when Manyurova was able to score three points in a last-ditch effort to extend the match into a third period. In the end, the medal was decided by luck: drawn into a par terre, Manyurova chose the red ball and was given the advantageous position, using it to score a single point that gave her the bronze. The final podium spot was contested between Vasilisa Marzalyuk of Belarus, runner-up at the most recent European Championships and bronze medalist at the 2005 edition as well as the 2011 World Championships, and Maider Unda of Spain, who had finished fifth in the 2008 Games and had bronze medals from the 2009 World Championships and the 2010 and 2012 European Championships. The duo was evenly matched, but Unda managed to get one point past the Belarusian in each round to win a second bronze at the impressive age of 35.

With three World titles in total (2012, 2014, 2015), Gray last defeat in a World Championship match was in 2013 to Zhang Fengliu of China, who went on to win that year title but had struggled since then. Gray was favoured to become the first American woman to win an Olympic wrestling gold medal.
Not to be discounted was the experienced two-time Olympic medalist Gyuzel Manyurova of Kazakhstan (2004 silver, 2012 bronze). Also fancied was Canada Erica Wiebe, who arrived in Rio world-ranked No. 2, despite just a handful of Grand Prix wins, and had yet to reach the podium at the World Championships.
Gray went out of the competition much earlier than expected when âsomethingâ was missing in her quarter-final match against Vasilisa Marzalyuk of Belarus who Gray has dominated in the past, but lost 4-1 on this occasion.
Ultimately, it was the rookie (Wiebe) and the veteran (Manyurova) who would meet in the gold medal match. The Canadian Wiebe, in her Olympic dÃ©but, did not concede a single point in either the semi-final or final. She dominated the 38-year old Kazakh Manyurova, winning by a score of 6-0, after beating Marzalyuk, Zhang and Germany Maria Selmaier earlier in the day. Canada has never missed the podium since women wrestling made its Olympic dÃ©but in Athens in 2004. With this Olympic title, Wiebe followed in the footsteps of her countrywomen, two-time Olympic medalist Carol Huynh, (2008 gold, 2012 bronze) and three-time Olympic medalist Tonya Verbeek (2004 and 2012 silvers, 2008 bronze).
Bronze medals went to Zhang, who defeated Wiebe semi-final opponent Marzalyuk 8-4 in the first of the bronze medal matches, while the other went to Yekaterina Bukina of Russia who defeated Laure Ali of Cameroon 5-3, thus depriving of Cameroon of their first ever wrestling medal, male or female.

He had switched to heavyweight in 2010 and again won a gold medal in the Asian Games, as well as at that year Asian Championships. Yazdani was a favorite, but he was expected to be challenged by Abdusalam Gadisov who, as the 2012 European Champion, represented the strong Russian presence in this event, as Russian wrestlers had won the past two Olympics. These two were the favorites and, when they were drawn into the same bracket, the question of who would challenge for gold remained an elusive one.
Yazdani and Gadisov met in the 1/8th finals, where Yazdani emerged victorious and moved on to the semi-finals, where he experienced intense pain from an old knee injury in the first period fight against Valeriy Andriitsev of Ukraine and had to be taken out of the arena in a wheelchair. Andriitsev was the runner-up at the most recent European Championships and met Jake Varner of the United States in the gold medal match, who was a bronze medalist from the 2011 World Championships. The two were ferocious, but evenly-matched, in the final but Varner was able to score just one point in each period to earn the Olympic crown.
The first bronze medal bout was contested between Kurban Kurbanov of Uzbekistan, 2011 Asian Champion, runner-up at the 2010 Asian Games, and bronze medalist at the 2007 World Championships, and Giorgi Gogshelidze of Georgia, a former competitor for Russia who was a 2008 Olympic bronze medalist, 2001 World Champion, and 2008 European Champion among a host of other accolades. Kurbanov managed to push Gogshelidze out of the ring in the first period to win it, but the Georgian got his revenge by scoring four unanswered points in the first minute of the second round. In the final period, Gogshelidze continued to be dominant and evoked little response from the Uzbek, winning the bronze medal with a score of 2-0. The battle for the final podium spot would ostensibly have been between Yazdani and the winner of repÃªchage round two but, with the Iranian injured, the true deciding match was the repÃªchage, fought between Rustam Iskandari of Tajikistan, a rookie, and Xetaq Qazyumov of Azerbaijan, 2008 Olympic bronze medalist, 2010 World Champion, 2009 world runner-up, and thrice European Champion (2009-2011). Qazyumov was the overwhelming favorite and did not disappoint; although Iskandari scored the first point, he was not able to repeat it, losing 1-3 and 0-3 to give the Azerbaijani his second Olympic bronze.

Thereafter he was absent from major competitions for three years as he switched allegiances to Bulgaria and made his return by winning a bronze medal at the 2011 European Championships prior to his victory at the World Championships. He faced challenges from several wrestlers in his quest for Olympic glory, most notably Jimmy Lidberg of Sweden, who was twice runner-up (2009 and 2011) and once a bronze medalist (2010) at the World Championships.
Guri and Lidberg were drawn into the same half, setting up a potentially exciting semi-final match, but it was not to be: both wrestlers were eliminated in the quarterfinals. Guri was defeated by Timofey Deynichenko of Belarus, runner-up at the 2010 European and World Championships, while Lindberg was bested by 2011 World Championship bronze medalist Rustam Totrov of Russia. Totrov then conquered Deynichenko in the semifinals, eliminating any chance of Guri winning a medal. In the final the Russian met Ghasem Rezaei of Iran, a two-time Asian Champion (2007 and 2008) whose best finish at the World Championships was third in 2007.The first round went to par terre where, although Totrov almost managed to rise from the bottom position, he was taken down at the last moment by Rezaei and scored upon. The second period again went to par terre, despite the best efforts of the Russian, who was unable to convert his top advantage to a point, even with a fantastic push that tossed both competitors out of the ring simultaneously (and therefore scored no points). Thus Iran, which had begun the 2012 Olympics with zero Greco-Roman gold medals to its name, left the tournament with three, following earlier victories by Hamid Soryan and Omid Noroozi in the featherweight and lightweight categories respectively.
Lidberg and Deynichenko, meanwhile, met up in a bronze medal bout, where Deynichenko took an early lead by reversing the Swede advantage in the first par terre and scoring two points in the dying seconds of the period. Lidberg struck back in the next two rounds, however, starting with a successful defense in the second par terre that forced a third, decisive period. This round too went to par terre, but the Swede had fewer cautions and was therefore granted the top advantage, using it to score four points to Deynichenko one in the final twenty-two seconds of the match and clinch the bronze. The final podium spot was decided between Yunior Estrada of Cuba and Artur Aleksanyan of Armenia, the 2012 European Champion and 2011 runner-up. For many years, including an appearance at the 2008 Summer Olympics, Estrada was a light-heavyweight wrestler and had won bronze in this division at the 2007 Pan American Games. He had switched to heavyweight by 2010, however, and won gold at the 2011 Pan American Games. In the bronze medal bout, Aleksanyan was dominant: he converted his top advantage in the round one par terre to two points and then pushed Estrada out of the ring in the second period to claim victory.

The high jump was contested on 10 April. The opening height was 1.50 metres, and all jumpers were required to jump at each height. The bar was initially raised 5 centimetres at a time; this interval was changed to 2.5 centimetres after 1.60 metres was negotiated. Fritz Hofmann (GER) was the first to be eliminated, as he cleared 1.55 but failed at 1.60.  Sweden Henrik SjÃ¶berg cleared 1.60 but went out at 1.625 and finished 4th, leaving the three Americans, Ellery Clark, James B. Connolly, and Bob Garrett.

Johnson was snubbed by Adolf Hitler, who had congratulated all the other winners on that day, but refused to shake the hand of a black man. He was then told by the IOC to congratulate all the winners or none of them, and chose none.

The favorite for the 1908 Olympics was probably the great Irish jumper, Con Leahy, who had won the AAA title from 1905-08.

The best American jumper was Harry Porter, who in 1908 won the AAU title and the Eastern Olympic Trial.  Porter had also been 2nd at the 1905 IC4A Meet.
The Official Report makes no mention of qualifying conditions but there were eight scheduled qualifying sections, which were consolidated into four pools.  After Pool One had been completed at the South End of the Stadium, the officials decided that the slippery conditions were unsuitable and moved the remaining three pools to another jumping area at the North End of the Stadium.  Herbert Gidney (USA), who had not qualified in the first pool, then lodged a protest, claiming that the original results of the first pool should be declared void and the competition held again under more favorable conditions at the North End.  Despite the fact that all the competitors had been equally affected by the original adverse conditions, the judges, rather surprisingly, upheld Gidney protest.
Otto Monsen (NOR) and Edward Leader (GBR) had shared first place in the original competition, but Monsen refused to take part in the re-scheduled event, while Leader failed to match the height he had achieved in the less favorable conditions.  The only beneficiary of the protest was Gidney himself.
Having won the competition, Harry Porter made three unsuccessful attempts at the world record height of 6-5 5/8Â­ (1.97). For these world record attempts, Porter removed his sweater for the first time in the competition.  In the final, IstvÃ¡n Somodi (HUN) was the only competitor to improve on his qualifying mark in the morning.  Leahy, Somodi, and GÃ©o AndrÃ© (FRA) had a jump-off for the silver and bronze medals, but none could equal their earlier marks so they were declared equal second.
After the Olympics, Harry Porter continued to be a top jumper.  He led the 1909 world lists with 6-4 (1.93), and tied for first in 1911 at the AAU Meet, but he did not compete at the 1912 Olympics.

There was a jump-off to decide the third and fourth places between Count Trissino and Georges Van Der Poele, aboard Ludlow.
The best on record in this era was 2.40 metres set by Heatherbloom, ridden by Dick Donnelly at Richmond, Virginia in 1902, although Heatherbloom and Donnelly had unofficial marks in 1902 of 2.49 and 2.515 metres. However, the first recognized FEI (FÃ©dÃ©ration Ãquestre Internationale) high jump record was 2.35 metres by Conspirateur, ridden by Captain Crousse (FRA) at the Grand Palais in Paris on 12 April 1906.

Lynn Thomas wrote in the March 1968 issue of Skating magazine, âThe demonstration started with several compulsory dances being skated with two couples on the ice. This produced the effect of shadow skating and was very attractive.â The pairs performed a compulsory dance, an original set dance, and a free dance. Ten couples participated with three pairs from Great Britain, two from the Soviet Union, and one each from Canada, West Germany, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and the United States.

No Swedes or Norwegians competed, even though those nations won two of the three team gymnastics events in 1912.

They believed that gymnastics was a team sport, which should be practiced in mass displays.
The individual event was won by Italy Alberto Braglia, who defended the individual all-around gold medal he had won at London in 1908.  In addition to his gold medal, he retained possession of the Challenge Trophy for the individual all-around.  This trophy had been donated for the 1908 Olympics by the City of Prague.  Braglia had also been runner-up in both individual events at the 1906 Olympics in Athens.  After his 1908 Olympic championships, Braglia used his Olympic fame to become a circus performer.  Working on a trapeze, he sustained a serious injury from a fall in 1910.  But he recovered from that setback to return to the Olympics in 1912 at Stockholm.

One of the world top road racers, the winner of the Tour de France in 1997, Ullrich was a time trial specialist and was the favorite. His biggest competition was expected to come from Lance Armstrong. Armstrong had competed in both the 1992 and 1996 Olympics, but had not yet an Olympic medal. Shortly after the 1996 Olympics, he was discovered to have testicular cancer, which had metastasized to his brain and liver. Enduring long courses of chemotherapy, and several surgeries, his return to the professional peloton was in doubt. But return he did, winning the Tour de France in both 1999 and 2000, with Ullrich second in 2000, and Armstrong would eventually win the race seven consecutive times â 1999-2005. Also formidable in the time trial, the race was expected to come down to these two, and they were the last two riders off. The 25th rider to start, of 38, was Russian Vyacheslav Yekimov. Yekimov, a 1988 gold medalist in the team pursuit and former world champion in the individual pursuit, was now a top professional road racer, and had served as a capable lieutenant on Armstrong US Postal Service team. He had a very long career and in the late 80s, had been the top individual pursuiter in the world for the Soviet Union. When Yekimov started the time trial, the leader was Kazakh Andrey Teteryuk but Yekimov finished in 57:40, besting Teteryuk by over a minute. And the time held up as numerous top pros had failed to better it by the time Armstrong and Ullrich started. At the first checkpoint, they trailed Yekimov time, and they were never able to get ahead of him, as Yekimov won a very surprising gold medal, with Ullrich second and Armstrong seemingly winning his only Olympic medal, a bronze.
Even though Armstrong was the dominant cyclist of the decade whispers of drug use continued to haunt him. He may have retired with the reputation intact but the United States Anti-Doping agency were hard on his trail. In August 2012 they announced that their long investigation had concluded that he had used illegal performance-enhancing drugs from 1998 onwards and they voided his results for the period of his greatest successes including all his Tour De France victories. His Olympic medal was also forfeited.

With a decorated past as a track cyclist that included six gold medals at the World Championships and four at the Olympics, his more recent successes as a road cyclist included second place in the time trial at the 2011 World Championships and an overall win of the Tour de France less than two weeks prior. This made him the favorite to capture the gold in the 2012 Olympic Time Trial, but he had to contend with Tony Martin, the reigning World Champion and perhaps the only rider who could truly challenge Wiggins for the top spot; Martin injury-plagued season, however, left his ability to challenge for the gold in doubt. The defending Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara was a potential challenger as well, but the crash he suffered during the road race several days earlier hampered his speed during the time trial and he was never a factor for the podium.
There were no surprises in the race: Wiggins dominated the course throughout and Martin came in with a comfortable second-place finish. Wigginsâ teammate Christopher Froome, who had come in second overall at the most recent Tour de France, took home the bronze. Wigginsâ victory gave him the highest lifetime total of medals for a British Olympian with seven, although the man he surpassed, rower Steven Redgrave, still held the title of most successful Olympian with five gold medals compared to Wigginsâ four.

The 35-year-old Cancellara had a record seven world championship medals to his credit, including four golds in the five years 2006-10, whilst Martin, runner-up to Wiggins in 2012, had won six world championship medals going back to 2009, and was the winner in three successive years 2011-13. Also in the field was the 2015 World Champion Vasily Kiriyenko of Belarus, Tour de France winner and bronze medallist at London in 2012 Chris Froome from Great Britain and Australia Rohan Dennis, who won the 13.8km stage one time trial at Utrecht in the 2015 Tour de France with a speed of 55.446 km/h, the fastest ever stage win in the history of the Tour.
There were no changes in the format since London 2012, with the 35 starters setting off at 90-second intervals over the 54.4 km circuit which started from Tim Maia Square in Pontal, west Rio de Janeiro. After a 2.5 km ride on the flat, the riders entered the 24.7 km Grumari circuit, which they completed two laps of before the ride back to the starting point.
Namibia Dan Craven was the first to set off at 10.00 am but his time of 18:09.45 for the first split was a time that would be bettered by all the other 34 riders and indeed he eventually finished the race in last place, more than 15 1/2 minutes behind the winner. But eyes were on the last riders to set off as this group contained all the fancied riders and it was one of the pre-race favourites, Fabian Cancellara, the 2008 Beijing gold medallist, who led from the Australian Rohan Dennis with Britain Geraint Thomas in third place at the first split.
Cancellara slipped to fourth place at split two while Dennis moved into the lead with the Netherlands Tom Dumoulin moving from fourth to second, and with Spain Jonathan Castroviejo moving into the bronze medal position.
It all changed again at split three when Cancellara was back in the lead with Dennis down to second, after he had to change bikes after his handlebar snapped, and Dumoulin holding on to third place with Chris Froome breathing down his neck. With only the ninth best time in split four, Dennis was out of the medal positions in fourth place whilst Froome was into third, Dumoulin up to second place and Cancellara holding on to the lead.
The honour of returning the fastest time in the fifth and final section belonged to NÃ©lson Oliveira of Portugal but he could only finish seventh overall while the top three each held on to their respective places which meant Fabian Cancellara regained the title he last won in Beijing eight years earlier in what was to be his final international race in an illustrious career that has seen him win eight stages in the Tour de France and 29 yellow jerseys, the most by any rider never to have won the race. For Dumoulin, he had the honour of winning the first men time trial medal for the Netherlands.
As for the much-fancied Tony Martin, Rio was a disaster and the nearest he got to a medal place was in recording the fifth best time in split one, but after that he got progressively worse and was classified 12th with the reigning World Champion Kiryienko even further back in 17th place.

Thru 2001 he had been one of Armstrong lieutenants on the US Postal Service team but he left in 2002 to ride for Team CSC. He was renowned for his efforts in the 2003 Tour de France, in which he fractured his collarbone early in the race, but continued to ride despite the pain, winning the 16th stage in a long solo breakaway and placing fourth in GC in Paris. In 2004 he moved to Phonak but this time had to leave the Tour de France after a back injury sustained in a 13th stage fall, and then had to deal with the death of his beloved golden retriever, Tugboat (aka Tugger). On the Vouliagmeni course, Hamilton started out slowly as his earpiece radio was broken and he could not hear the splits. But he finished the race stronger than any rider and bested the time of defending gold medalist Vyacheslav Yekimov by almost 19 seconds, winning the gold medal.
And then the excrement struck the cooling apparatus. Hamilton doping test showed evidence of blood doping. But it was not conclusive, and no action was taken initially, so the B sample was frozen. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) asked for a review of the tests, but with the B sample having been frozen, it was inadequate to test for blood transfusions. Because a doping positive required both the A and B samples to be positive, Hamilton was exonerated and retained his gold medal.
A few weeks later, racing in the Vuelta a EspaÃ±a, Hamilton again tested positive for blood transfusions, and this time both the A and B samples were positive. He lost his contract with Phonak, and was banned from cycling for two years, despite appeals to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), which were rejected. When Hamilton ban was about to run out in late 2006, he was then implicated in the Spanish doping scandal, OperaciÃ³n Puerto, when faxes which seemed to be from Hamilton wife, Haven, showed evidence of payments for various performance enhancing drugs. Hamilton finally was able to return to competition in approved races in 2008 and immediately won the U.S. National Championship. But the entire episode took a huge toll on him financially and he and his wife divorced after the strain affected their marriage.
In 2009 Hamilton again failed a doping test and was banned for eight years and he retired from competition, of necessity. In May 2011 he admitted to doping during his career. In August 2012 the IOC disqualified Hamilton from the 2004 Olympics after he had written a letter to IOC President Rogge admitting his doping violations. Later in 2012 he published a book The Secret Race in which he detailed his doping history and implicated many professional riders for widespread doping in the professional peleton.

Finally, in 1991 he won the Tour, and he would then win it from 1991-95, only the fourth five-time winner of the Tour, and the first to do it five times consecutively. IndurÃ¡in specialty was the individual time trial, the contre la montre to the French, but also known as the âRace of Truth,â because it so often determined the champion in major stage races.
In 1996, IndurÃ¡in finally was defeated at the Tour de France, placing 11th behind Denmark Bjarne Riis. He was going to skip the Olympics, citing fatigue, until a special appeal from IOC President [Juan Antonio Samaranch](/athletes/899318. The early leader in the race was Chris Boardman, gold medalist in 1992 in the individual pursuit. The next-to-last to start was Abraham Olano, World Champion in 1995 on the road. He surpassed Boardman time and took the lead. IndurÃ¡in went off last and was ahead of Boardman leading splits at all the early marks and won, besting Olano time by 12 seconds, with Boardman winning the bronze.

She entered the time trial in Sydney as the favorite and her entire 2000 Olympics was the stuff of wonder. She would win the time trial by a comfortable 37-second margin over surprising American Mari Holden. She would also win gold in Sydney in the individual pursuit and the road race, and added a fourth medal, silver, in the points race. After the Olympics, Holden won the World Championship in this event, although Zijlaard-van Moorsel did not compete. Jeannie Longo-Ciprelli, the bronze medalist, is the greatest female road cyclist ever, with a huge list of palmares. She was World Champion in this event in 1995-97 and would win again in 2001. Holden had not raced much internationally but later in 2000 she would win the World Time Trial Championship.

She returned in 2011, however, with the goal of defending her Olympic title in 2012 and had strong performances in the time trial in the lead-up to the London Games. A fall that broke her collarbone just over two months before the Olympics, however, jeopardized her chances of competing in the event, but an accelerated recovery left her as the favorite for the top spot on the podium in 2012. Among her strongest challengers were Germany Judith Arndt, the reigning World Champion who had been winning cycling medals since her Olympic individual pursuit bronze in 1996, and the Danish-born Linda Villumsen, competing for New Zealand since 2010, who was the runner-up in the event at the 2011 World Championships. Also notable were Emma Pooley, the 2008 Olympic runner-up and the host nation best chance for a medal in the event, and Canadian Clara Hughes, vying to become her country most decorated Olympian after having won two cycling bronze medals at the 1996 Summer Olympics before switching to speed skating and earning four Olympic medals at the Winter Olympics between 2002 and 2010, including gold in the 5000m event in 2006. The Dutch cyclist Marianne Vos, who just days before had won the road race and who, in 2008, had won the Olympic points race, could not be ignored either.
In a tough field it was once again the lower-ranked Russian Olga Zabelinskaya who, after surprising spectators with a bronze medal win the road race over the weekend, set an incredibly high bar earlier on by finishing the course with a time of 37:57.35. Pooley, Hughes, and Villumsen all failed to best this mark and, with Vos having been overtaken by Arndt (thus making up the 90 second difference in their starts), Zabelinskaya time guaranteed her a medal. Arndt slid in at a comfortable seven seconds ahead of her Russian competitor, but Armstrong raw power never lapsed throughout the event and she arrived at the finish line over fifteen seconds faster than the German, easily defending her Olympic title.

The race started and finished in the Speedway. Anna van der Breggen of the Netherlands won the 2020 World Time Trial Championship at Imola, and was runner-up in both 2018 and 2019. Compatriot Annemiek van Vleuten was world champion in 2018 and the bronze medallist the following year. It was hard to imagine any outcome of the time trial in Tokyo other than complete Dutch domination, although ChloÃ© Dygert of the USA was the most likely non-European for a medal. Dygert was coached by Kristin Armstrong, who won three consecutive Olympic time trial gold medals. The newly crowned road race champion Anna Kiesenhofer was disappointed at not qualifying for the time trial.
Three days before the time trial, 38-year-old van Vleuten crossed the line in the road race with arms aloft, thinking she had won, when Austria Kiesenhofer had actually crossed the line 75 seconds earlier. Now, she wanted to add an elusive Olympic gold medal to go with her many national, European and world titles. Van Vleuten laid down the marker at the first split at 9.7 km with a time of 14:24.58, six seconds ahead of Australia Grace Brown, with van der Breggen more than 12 seconds behind Brown in third place.
At the 15 km split, van Vleuten still led and was now 28 seconds up on Brown, with van der Breggen still in the bronze medal position. At the end of the race, it was still the two Netherlands riders in first and third but Switzerland Marlen Reusser, who had finished second to van der Breggen at the 2020 World Championships, clawed herself back from fourth and fifth at the first two splits respectively, to clinch the silver medal. Van Vleuten won by 56.47 secs, and for the woman who came close to death after an horrific accident in Rio, she now had her hands on an Olympic gold medal at last.

After all, she had won the Olympic title in 2008 and 2012, had two World Time Trial titles to her name and won her fourth US National Time Trial title after coming out of retirement in 2015 â eight years after her last success. She may have been 43-years-of-age the day after the Rio race, but with age came experience. Having retired after Beijing, and for a second time after London, it was another comeback for the American as she sought Olympic title number three. Linda Villumsen of New Zealand and Lisa Brennauer of Germany were the 2015 and 2014 World Time Trial Champions respectively and offered a serious challenge to Armstrong. Villumsen had six World titles to her name.
There were no changes in the format since London 2012, with the 25 starters setting off at 90-second intervals over the 29.7 km circuit which started from Tim Maia Square in Pontal, west Rio de Janeiro. After a 2.5 km ride on the flat, the riders entered the 24.7 km Grumari circuit, which they completed one lap of before the ride back to the starting point.
As expected, Armstrong set the early pace on a rainy day in Pontal, leading through the first split, just less than five seconds ahead of the Italian Elisa Longo Borghini, the daughter of the Olympic cross country skier Guidina Dal Sasso, with the Netherlands rider Anna van der Breggen, the 2015 World Championship runner-up, in third place. Van der Breggen and Longo Borghini had finished first and third respectively in the Rio road race just three days earlier.
Up from sixth to first place at split two was Russia London 2012 bronze medallist Olga Zabelinskaya, the daughter of the 1980 Olympic road race champion Sergey Sukhoruchenkov. Armstrong was 2.88 seconds behind in second place with the Italian Longo Borghini a further 4.1 seconds adrift in third.
It was a case of too little too late for the 2014 World Champion Lisa Brennauer who, despite the fastest time in the final phase could only finish a lowly eighth, while Armstrong clawed back Zabelinskaya to overtake her at the top of the leaderboard and beat the Russian by 5.55 seconds to take her third consecutive Olympic gold medal whilst van der Breggen ousted Longo Borghini to take the bronze medal. As she crossed the line, Armstrong was so exhausted after her final sprint, she collapsed. But she had vindicated her selection onto the US team which many had criticised at the time as she became the first female cyclist, track or road, to win the same event at three consecutive Olympics.
For Zabelinskaya, she raised her arms thinking she had secured gold as she crossed the line only to watch disappointingly as Armstrong deprived her of gold. Had the Russian won, that too would have been controversial as she had returned to the sport shortly before the Games following a drugs ban.

In fact, George Thorne and Mackenzie Turpie tied again in the playoff with nets of 84, and we think they played off again to determine places 4 and 5.
Lambert also competed in the Olympic competition, finishing eighth with rounds of 94-95.  He was from St. Louis and when Olympic golf returned to St. Louis in 1904, Lambert would again compete, making him the only person to play in both Olympic golf tournaments.  In fact, Lambert was the man responsible for the 1904 Olympic golf event.
Lambert was a wealthy man.  He founded Lambert Pharmacal Co., later Warner-Lambert, best-known as the makers of Listerine.  His avocation in later years became flying and he was the primary benefactor for Charles Lindbergh trans-atlantic flight.  For his contributions to aviation, the St. Louis airport was named Lambert International Field.
In 1900 Lambert played the Olympic golf event while on a business trip to his Paris office.  On his return he mentioned the Olympic golf event to his father-in-law, Colonel George McGrew.  McGrew was the founder of Glen Echo Golf Club in St. Louis and with the Olympics coming to St. Louis in 1904, Lambert and McGrew put forth plans to conduct an Olympic golf tournament at Glen Echo.

A surprising crash onto the mat by Gao of China during his second routine of the qualifiers resulted in a disappointing score of 10.575 in addition to his 52.245, plummeting him down to 14th place and preventing him from advancing to the final.
Dong seemed well on his way to another gold medal finishing with a score of 61.235 in his final routine, until Ivan Litvinovich of Belarus, who finished first in the qualifiers, put up a score of 61.715 to surpass him and claim the gold. Dylan Schmidt of New Zealand finished with the bronze with a score of 60.675, enough to pass the defending champion Hancharou (60.565) of Belarus. This would be Belarusâ first medal of Tokyo 2020.

Charles Sands took up golf in 1895 and only three months later went to the final of the first Amateur Championship of the USGA.  There he met the redoubtable Charles Blair MacDonald, and Sandsâ lack of experience showed as MacDonald won easily, 12 and 11.  Sands never again played in the U. S. Amateur, and that and his Olympic triumph constitute his entire golfing laurels.
Sands was a well-known athlete, though.  Primarily a tennis player, he was the United Statesâ champion in 1905 in court tennis, the original form of the game.  He is one of only two American athletes to have competed in the Olympics in three sports â 1900 in golf, 1900 in lawn tennis, and 1908 in jeu de paume (the original name of court tennis).
Al Lambert, the winner of the handicap event, also competed in the Olympic competition, finishing eighth with rounds of 94-95.  Lambert was from St. Louis and when Olympic golf returned to St. Louis in 1904, Lambert would again compete, making him the only person to play in both of the initial Olympic golf tournaments.  In fact, Lambert was the man responsible for the 1904 Olympic golf event.
Lambert was a wealthy man.  He founded Lambert Pharmacal Co., later Warner-Lambert, best-known as the makers of Listerine.  His avocation in later years became flying and he was the primary benefactor for Charles Lindbergh trans-atlantic flight.  For his contributions to aviation, the St. Louis airport was named Lambert International Field.
In 1900 Lambert played the Olympic golf event while on a business trip to his Paris office.  On his return he mentioned the Olympic golf event to his father-in-law, Colonel George McGrew.  McGrew was the founder of Glen Echo Golf Club in St. Louis and with the Olympics coming to St. Louis in 1904, Lambert and McGrew put forth plans to conduct an Olympic golf tournament at Glen Echo.

At Salt Lake City, he had won a silver medal in the sprint and the team event. But disaster struck on his first jump in Torino, landing at only 92.5 metres, 101/2 less than Norway leader Petter Tande, and Ackermann stood 25.5 points behind. His second jump was little better, and he finished the jumping tied for 26th, 49 points, and 3:16 behind his teammate, Georg Hettich. Tande, the 2005 World Junior Champion, was in second after the second jump, starting two seconds behind Hettich in the 15 km. The other favorite was thought to be Finland Hannu Manninen, who had only medaled at the World Championships in the team event, but was the World Cup champion in 2003-04, 2004-05, and was leading in the current season. He placed eighth on the hill, and was 1:38 back starting the 15 km.
In the ski race, Hettich maintained his lead throughout, winning by 9.8 seconds over Austrian Felix Gottwald, who had placed 11th in the jumping, but was second in the skiing. Tande struggled in the cross-country, finishing only 22nd in that section, and dropping out of the medals, finishing fourth, passed by Austrian Felix Gottwald. He was passed by his teammate, Magnus Moan, who had been ninth in the jumping, but had the third-best ski time, which brought him onto the podium. Moan would place second in the World Cup in 2005-06 and 2006-07. Ackermann had a horrible event, placing 15th in skiing, and 18th overall, but he would again win the World Championships in 2007 and the World Cup in 2007-08. The other favorite, Manninen, finished only 14th in the 15 km, and dropped down to ninth place, even out of the diplomas.

It was designed by John Barry, who rode for the USA at the 1920 and 1924 Olympics, and Sloan Doak, an Olympian in 1920-28, and had 18 obstacles and 20 jumping efforts over a length of 1,060 metres. Only 11 riders from four nations started the competition, but the course was so hard that only five riders finished. The rules stated that three refusals by a horse eliminated horse and rider, which led to the small finishing field.
Clarence von Rosen, Jr. had already won a bronze medal in Los Angeles in the 3-day event, and was the early leader in the competition. But American Harry Chamberlin on Show Girl finished with only 12 faults to move into the lead. The last rider was the Japanese Takeichi, Baron Nishi on Uranus who came through with only 8 faults to win the gold medal, with Chamberlin taking silver and von Rosen bronze.
Takeichi, the 2nd Baron Nishi, was well-known in America, and very popular among the Hollywood crowd, but paradoxically would also be a top Japanese Imperial Army officer during World War II. In 1944, Baron Nishi was named regimental commander of the 26th Tank Regiment, Mudanjiang, which was assigned to defend Iwo Jima. He died during the defense of Iwo Jima, but circumstances of his death are not precisely known and many stories have circulated as to the cause. Some stories say he committed suicide, some say he was killed by machine-gun fire, and some say he was killed by American flamethrowers. His horse, Uranus, died one week later.

But the leader after the third and fourth phases was a surprise, Italian Cesare Toraldo. He led Kazakh Alex Parygin by 46 points going into the cross-country run, with Svatkovsky struggling back in ninth place. In third place was the 1988 gold medalist, JÃ¡nos Martinek, who had been a big surprise back in 1988 and had done little internationally since then. Eduard Zenovka, who had lost the 1992 gold medal with a disastrous ride in the last phase, was in sixth place but was known to be a very strong runner. In fact, he pulled ahead and took the lead with several hundred metres remaining. He would win the run, but the effort of pulling ahead had drained him and he stumbled in the stretch and fell, allowing Parygin, who was virtually unknown in the sport, to pass him for the gold medal. Zenovka recovered to get the silver, with Martinek winning bronze. In 1993, Zenovka had had much worse luck. Driving a truck with his fiancÃ©, he crashed the truck while under the influence.

Nobody was able to ride cleanly in round two, but when Steinkraus came home with only 4 faults the gold medal was his. Coakes had 8 faults and won the silver aboard Stroller, a horse so small at 142 cm, that it was more properly called a pony . Four riders tied for third with 12 faults â Broome, Chapot, German Hans GÃ¼nter Winkler, and Canadian Jim Elder. In the jump-off for the bronze medal all four rode cleanly, but Broome won the bronze with the fastest time of 35.3 seconds. Of those who made the second round, the last finisher was Australian Kevin Bacon, who was at least six degrees outside of first.

The course was 780 metres, and was designed by Shunzo Kido, a 1928-32 Olympian. There were 14 obstacles, with 17 jumps. The major obstacles came near the end, with the next-to-last obstacle a water jump of 5.00 metres, then, after a left turn, an oxer measuring 1.45 x 1.50 x 1.85 metres. It had rained for several days, which had made the ground very deep and soft, but it was fortunately not slippery.
The last three European Championships had been won by Graziano Mancinelli (1963), David B. Barker (1962), and David Broome (1961). There had been no World Championships since the 1960 Olympics. The leaders after the first round were Britain Peter Robeson, Australian John Fahey, and Portugal Joaquim Silva, all of whom had 8.00 faults. The 1952 gold medalist, Pierre JonquÃ¨res dâOriola, was alone in fourth place with 9.00 faults. In the second round, JonquÃ¨res dâOriola had a clean ride, giving him a total of 9.00 faults and allowing him to win a second gold medal in the event, 12 years after his first. German Hermann Schridde had the next best ride of the second round, with only 1.25 faults, giving him the silver medal with 13.75 faults. Robeson and Fahey tied at 16.00 faults and rode-off, with Robeson riding cleanly for the bronze medal.

The competition was held over two rounds, with the total number of faults for both rounds determining placement. The course had 14 obstacles, although the 5th obstacle was a double one, and the 12th was a three-part obstacle, thus with 17 jumps spread over 775 metres, with the time allowance given for a speed of 400 m/min.
The favorite was German Hans GÃ¼nter Winkler who had won the World Championships in 1954 and 1955. Winkler led after the first round with only 4.00 faults, trailed by the defending gold medalist Pierre JonquÃ¨res dâOriola with 7.00, and five riders with 8.00 faults â including the Italian DâInzeo brothers and Pat Smythe. However, Winkler had pulled a muscle in his groin towards the end of the first round, and only started the final round to help his German team in the team competition with the aid of painkillers. However he was not able take the amount he needed to be comfortable in the saddle and was given coffee to help combat dizziness and double vision before he rode.  Riding his prize horse Halla, Winkler rode a clean second round to win the gold medal with a total of 4.00 faults, as Halla seemed to ride the course on her own. The silver medal went to Raimondo DâInzeo, whose second round was the only other clean ride in the competition. His brother, Piero DâInzeo, was the bronze medalist, finishing with 11.00 faults.
Winkler competed at six Olympics (1956-76) winning five gold medals, one silver, and one bronze, but this was his only individual medal. Raimondo DâInzeo competed at eight Olympics (1948-76), winning six medals with one gold â in this event in 1960. His brother, Piero, also competed at the same eight Olympics, also winning six medals, but no golds. He would win the silver medal in this event in 1960.
Winkler mount Halla, a bay mare, would follow him to the 1960 Olympics and win a team gold there, in addition to his two jumping golds in Stockholm, as Halla became the first horse to win three Olympic gold medals. Halla was by a trotting stallion and was foaled on 16 May 1945. She competed through the Brussels Grand Prix on 25 October 1960 and then was retired to stud, later dying in 1979, at 34-years-old.

Behind Margaret Abbott in the women tournament came Polly Whittier and a lady listed in the past as Mrs. J. Huger Pratt of Dinard, France.  The three women were mysteries until research by Dr. Paula Welch, a sports historian at the University of Florida, unearthed their identities.
Margaret Abbott was born in Calcutta (Kolkata), India in 1876 to wealthy parents.  She learned her golf at the Chicago Golf Club but in 1900 was studying art in Paris, accompanied by her mother, who also played in the Olympic golf tournament (she finished seventh).  By winning the Olympic golf tournament she became the first American woman to win an Olympic event (and only the second overall).
Polly Whittier, often listed as being from Switzerland, was actually Pauline Whittier of Boston.  Also from a wealthy family, Whittier was a descendent of the famous poet, John Greenleaf Whittier, and in 1900 was studying in St. Moritz, hence the mistaken affiliation.
Mrs. J. Huger Pratt of Dinard was the former Daria Pankhurst.  Vacationing in France in 1900, she played her golf at the Dinard Club.  A short time after the Olympics, Daria Pratt second husband, Mr. Thomas Huger Pratt, died an early death.  She later married Prince Alexis Karageorgevitch of Serbia, thus becoming the Princess Karageorgevitch of Serbia.

But he was also a top archer and competed on the Finnish team that won the World Team Championship in 1958, and he was Finnish champion in archery in 1955. But Rautavaara is best remembered in Finland for his singing and acting. He toured Finland performing in the 50s and early 60s, and eventually recorded over 300 songs. He began acting in films and television after World War II, and appeared in over 20 movies.

Canada lineup, meanwhile, included K-2 500 runners-up Alexandra BarrÃ© and Sue Holloway, while West Germany had the bronze medalists Barbara SchÃ¼ttpelz and Josefa Idem. With only seven crews taking part, only a final was held and it developed into a three-way battle to the finish between Romania, Sweden, and Canada, who finished in that order and with just over one second separating them. West Germany, meanwhile, finished fifth, thus ending the first of Idem eight appearances at the Olympics, a record number for a woman in any sport.

In the first heat, Fredriksson was nearly defeated by the Soviet Union Igor Pisarev and managed to eke out a victory by only 0.2 seconds, while StrÃ¶mberg, suffering from stomach problems, was eliminated. In the next, both Kiss and Gantois were bested by a relatively unknown Stefan KapÅaniak of Poland, although, since every competitor in that heat advanced, it was likely that the others were merely conserving their strength. The final heat had no obvious favorites and was won by Germany Ernst Steinhauer, a World Champion in the K-2 500 and bronze medalist in the K-2 10000.

If there was any other contender for the crown, it was Germany Maximilian Levy, the 2009 World Champion and runner-up at the most recent edition.
Both riders easily won their heats in the first two rounds of competition, setting the stage for an edge-of-the-seat final match. In the final, Mohd Azizulhasni Awang of Malaysia made an early attack once the pacesetter left the track, but he was quickly overtaken by Hoy, who wasted no time bolting out to the front and giving it everything he had.

What should have been a strong French challenge from Pervis and teammate MichaÃ«l DâAlmeida fizzled out early but both Kenny and Eilers clinched their expected places in the final.
The final was a logistical disaster.  At the first attempt the race was halted when Kenny appeared to have overtaken the back wheel of the derny before it left the track but, after a delay of several minutes, he was allowed to continue in the event when video footage from a Team GB data analyst sitting in the stands was used to clear Kenny of any guilt. Amazingly no official camera was set up to judge this type of infraction. The second attempt saw an identical incident, and again the race was aborted with Eilers appearing to be the guilty party. Once again though it proved impossible to determine that any rule had been broken. By now the event was causing havoc with TV schedules and in Britain, where the exploits of Kenny and his fiancÃ©e Laura Trott were dominating newspaper front pages, the main evening news was delayed by 70 minutes to allow live coverage of the race.
Eventually, at the third attempt, the race was finally completed. Eilers and Damian ZieliÅski of Poland sprinted early and held a clear lead with a lap to go, but both faded and Kenny swooped around the outside to win his third gold medal of the 2016 Olympics and the sixth of his career. Matthijs BÃ¼chli of the Netherlands placed second while Mohd Azizulhasni Awang made a late lunge at the line to win Malaysia first ever Olympic cycling medal.
With six gold and a silver Kenny equalled exactly the tally of former teammate Chris Hoy and became the joint most successful British Olympian ever, at the age of only 28. His victory meant Great Britain had won three successive titles in the event each with a different rider.

The derny paces the riders for about 1,500 metres and then pulls off the track, at which time the cyclists begin a furious sprint to the finish.  Keirin racing has traditionally been raced in Japan, where it has been a professional sport for over 20 years, and in which pari-mutuel betting on the riders is permitted.
The last few World Championships had been split among Jens Fiedler (GER), Marty Nothstein (USA), and FrÃ©dÃ©ric MagnÃ© (FRA). All three made it to the final, where they were joined by top sprinters Florian Rousseau (FRA), Gary Neiwand (AUS), and Jan van Eijden (GER). When the derny pulled away, Fiedler jumped the field, but Neiwand took the lead on the last lap, only to be passed by Rousseau for the gold medal just before the line.

Though the Chinese riders were eliminated before the final, all the other favourites were all present.
Vogel took out the lead in the final but she faltered in the final stages, leaving Ligtlee to hold off the fast charging Becky James of Great Britain for the win. Ligtlee had only just qualified for the final after a fall by a Colombian rider had opened up space after she appeared trapped behind her opponents. Second placed James had appeared to be the next star in the sport back in 2013, when she won World Championship medals in four events, but major knee and shoulder injuries and a cancer scare had left her off the track for the best part of three years.

She was the favorite going into the event, although Pendleton was looking to redeem herself after being relegated in the previous day team sprint.
All of the most prominent competitors survived to the semi-finals, from which only Meares, Pendleton, Sanchez, and Guo, alongside Canadian Monique Sullivan and Lee Wai Sze of Hong Kong, made it to the final.  In the final Meares made the first attack after the pace vehicle moved aside, shooting into first place, but was quickly overtaken by Pendleton, who from then on never relinquished the lead. Having redeemed herself from the team sprint, Pendleton fought back tears as she completed the race and won herself a well-deserved gold medal. Guo took the silver while, in a surprising turn of events, Lee captured the bronze, which was only Hong Kong third Olympic medal since its NOC was founded in 1950. Meares fell to fifth in the standings, a disappointing result for the reigning World Champion.

Zaretska won pool A, although she suffered a narrow defeat to runner-up Sofya Berultseva (KAZ) by a score of 5-4. Berultseva actually drew her first contest with Meltem Hocaoglu Akyol (TUR) and lost her final contest when already assured of progressing to the semi-finals. Pool B had a close outcome with Abdelaziz, Li Gong (CHN) and Elena Quirici (SUI) all winning two and drawing one contest each, so finishing level.

The match was started at 1:00 PM (1300), immediately before the soccer final which resulted in a large crowd being present for the lacrosse game.  The vast majority of the spectators knew little of lacrosse and even those familiar with the game were often confused, as some rules had been modified to bring together certain differences in the Canadian and English laws.  The goal crease was enlarged and special restrictions prevented an opponent from entering it.  The ball was intermediate in weight between the lighter English ball and the heavier Canadian ball.  Play was also divided into four quarters instead of two halves.
At the end of the first quarter Canada led 5-1 and then 6-2 at half-time after which some brilliant play by England tied the game at 9-9, before Canada rallied to win the game, 14-10. The scoring was started by Henry Hoobin who put Canada ahead, 1-0, before Britain George Buckland equaled the match at 1-1. Canada led at the end of the first quarter, 5-1, and at halftime, 6-2, but Great Britain came back well, so that the lead was only 9-7 after three quarters. Britain then scored two goals to equalize the match at 9, but Canada was too strong near the end and pulled ahead 14-9, before Great Britain scored a final goal to make it 14-10. (Some reports have the score as 14-11, but 14-10 is most often seen and is the score in the 1908 Official Report.)
Excellent sportsmanship was demonstrated during the match.  When Canada Angus Dillon broke his stick and was having difficulty finding a replacement, England R. G. Martin agreed to stay out until Dillon returned.  At the end of the game, the players exchanged sticks, shook hands and congratulated each other on a well-played match.
Previous Canadian lacrosse teams to visit England had been known simply as âThe Canadiansâ and were usually from the Toronto area, but the Olympics marked the first time that a Canadian team had been selected on a nation-wide basis.  Several trial games were held before a team from clubs as far apart as New Westminster in the west and Montreal in the east was finally chosen.  The eventual make-up of the squad saw all parts of Canada represented: four members were from the Montreal Shamrocks, two from the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association, one from the Montreal Nationals, and two were from New Westminster.  One player each came from Calgary, Ottawa, Cornwall, Toronto, St. Catharines, and Orangeville.  The British also took unusual care over selection and the painstaking selection process adopted by both countries resulted in a game of the highest quality.

Sweden had two excellent jumpers from Kiruna, Thure Lindgren (silver medalist in the 1950 World Championship) and Karl HolmstrÃ¶m. Germany had two excellent athletes from the ski jumping center in Oberstdorf, Bavaria in Toni Brutscher and Sepp Weiler. Weiler, a veteran aged 31, was a former Wehrmacht soldier who had lost his left eye on the Russian front during the war.
There were 44 jumpers from 13 nations entered for the competition. Arnfinn Bergmann was the lowest ranked of the Norwegian jumpers although he had a bronze medal from the 1950 World Championships. He  took an early lead from his start number six with a stylish jump of 67,5 metres. Both the Swede Bror Ãstman and Toni Brutscher made solid jumps, but the young Finn Luiro failed badly. Nobody was able to beat Bergmann points before the last of the Norwegians, Falkanger was ready with start number 38. Under big ovations from the audience he landed a stylish jump safely at 68 metres, and Bergmann was relegated to second place. Later jumpers HyvÃ¤rinen and Weiler both made good jumps, but could not prevent the Norwegian double after the first round. The competition was very close as the difference in points between the first ten was only five.
In the second round, Bergmann got a perfect jump, equalling Falkanger 68 metres from the first round and had even better style points than his countryman. Most of the following jumpers were not able to match their distances from the first round. Ãstman fell, Norwegians Arne Hoel (63,5) and Halvor NÃ¦s (64,5) made good jumps and improved. Brutscher jumped 62,5 metres  and equaled NÃ¦s for second place in total points. HolmstrÃ¶m made a solid jump and took over the silver medal position. Falkanger had great pressure on his shoulders and jumped only 64 metres, but good style points kept him ahead of HolmstrÃ¶m, although behind Bergmann. HyvÃ¤rinen, lying in bronze medal position after the first round, could do only 61,5 metres and ended up in seventh place. The end was indeed happy for the Norwegian crowd, Bergmann gold, Falkanger silver, and all four jumpers among the six best.
Both Bergmann and Falkanger continued their jumping career. Falkanger won his third Norwegian championship 1954, but fell badly at Holmenkollen in December 1955 in a qualification competition for the 1956 Winter Olympics and had to give up jumping due to his injuries. Bergmann also failed to qualify for the 1956 Winter Olympics, but won his third national championships in 1958.

The old Kongsberg style developed in Norway after World War I, had the upper body bent at the hip, a wide forward lean, and arms extended in front of the skies parallel to each other. The DÃ¤scher style with stretched hip and arms placed backward for a closer lean reduced the air resistance and made it possible for the jumpers to improve their distance. German and Finnish jumpers were quick to adapt to the new technique, and one of the most skilled practitioners of the new technique was the best Soviet ski jumper, Georgian Kâoba Tsâakadze. His body was so close to his skies that his breast almost touched the front part of his skies.
The 1956 Olympic ski jumping competition was the real breakthrough for the aerodynamic technique. In the first round, Antti HyvÃ¤rinen, seventh in the 1952 games and jumping first of the favorites, took the lead with an 81 metre jump. The 23 year old German from Oberstdorf, Max Bolkart, jumped 80 metres  and equaled HyvÃ¤rinen points with his better style. Harry GlaÃ, a 25-year old from Klingenthal, East Germany, then made an excellent jump of 83,5 metres and was in the lead. Next to jump was Aulis Kallakorpi of Finland, winner at Holmenkollen in 1955. He equaled GlaÃâ length and was in second position, only 0,5 points behind the German. Jumping last of the 51 competitors, Andreas DÃ¤scher made a good jump of 82 metres and was in sixth position after the first round.
In the second round, HyvÃ¤rinen took an early lead with an excellent jump of 84 metres, the longest of the day. Tsâakadze, lying seventh after first round, made a gallant try to fight for a top placing, but fell after an 82,5 metre jump and was out of contention for the medals. Next of the favorites to challenge HyvÃ¤rinen lead was Harry GlaÃ, the first-round leader. He could only manage 80,5 metres and was 2,5 points behind HyvÃ¤rinen. Next to come was Kallakorpi, second-placed after the first round. He equaled GlaÃâ distance, and better style points brought him into the silver medal position with the closest possible margin, only 0,5 points. It ended with a Finnish double, with an East German jumper taking the bronze medal.
For Norway, the nation who had dominated the six former Olympic jumping competitions, winning all six and taking 14 out of 18 possible medals, the result came as a shock, their best jumper placing only ninth. The Norwegians had been reluctant to adapt to the new aerodynamic style and was severely punished for this. The era of Norwegian domination in ski jumping was definitely over.

The competition was totally dominated by Matti NykÃ¤nen, the silver medalist from the Normal hill. In the first round he made an impressive 116.0 m jump, nine meters longer than his closest opponent, the winner from the Normal hill Jens WeiÃflog. Austrian Armin Kogler, the best ski jumper at the 1982 World Championships with one gold and one bronze, revenged himself after his poor showing in the Normal hill by lying third.
In the second round, Kogler, starting as number 6, took an early lead and kept his position until Jari Puikkonen, the bronze winner from the Normal hill, took over the lead with a decent jump of 102.0 m. Then the US representative Jeff Hastings, lying 12th after the first round, surprised with a jump of 107.0 m, and suddenly an American was in a position for a medal. But the 19-year old Czech Pavel Ploc, who in 1983 had set a new world record of 181.0 m in his home town Harrachov, answered with a jump of 109.0 m and took over the lead with WeiÃflog and NykÃ¤nen yet to come. WeiÃflog improved half a meter from his first jump and was now first, over ten points ahead of Ploc. NykÃ¤nen, with his big lead after the first jump, could now secure his first Olympic gold medal with a safe jump of around 100 m, but the young Finn was not the type to make safe jumps. He once again made the best and longest jump of the round, 111.0 m. His victory margin was an impressive 17.5 points, the biggest victory margin in the history of Olympic ski jumping. Jeff Hastings fourth place was the best American placing in ski jumping for 60 years, only beaten by Anders Haugen bronze medal from 1924. For the ski-jump-loving nation of Norway, the event was described as a national catastrophe. Norway best jumper ended in 18th place, the nation worst ever Olympic ski jumping performance.

Ice in the run-in made the conditions difficult, and in the first round the jumpers were given reduced speed. The highly favored Norwegian team consisted of four jumping specialists, led by defending Olympic Champion Jacob Tullin Thams who also was the winner of the World Championships in 1926. After the first round, it looked like a new triumph for the Norwegians with Alf Andersen leading with the longest jump of the round of 60 m ahead of Sigmund Ruud  and Thams. The fourth Norwegian, Hans Kleppen, was out of contention after a fall. The most dangerous threat to the Norwegians was the winner of the Nordic Combined jumping event, Rudolf Burkert, and the home favorite GÃ©rard Vuilleumier.
In the break between the two rounds the Middle Europeans, led by the Swiss jumpers Vuilleumier and Bruno Trojani, requested top speed for the in-run, but the Scandinavians and US jumpers protested and argued that on the icy and fast snow this would be too dangerous. The quarrel lasted for 40 minutes, and in the end the Middle Europeans got what they wanted. The two leading Norwegians, Andersen and Ruud kept their head cool and left the tower in standing position to avoid full speed. They produced the two longest standing jumps of the competition with 64.0 and 62.5 m.  Defending champion Thams, however, was furious. Instead of taking a safe jump to win a medal, he was provoked by the Swiss jumpers taunting him about his cowardice, and gave full speed to produce a magnificent jump of 73.0 m. without a clean landing. Ironically, both Vuilleumier and Trojani became victims of the high speed and fell after jumps of 62.0 and 63.0 meters.
The competition ended with gold and silver for Norway. Alf Andersen became Olympic Champion, and Sigmund Ruud, the eldest of the famous Ruud brothers from Kongsberg, was second. Rudolf Purkert won the bronze medal, the first ever medal for his country in the Winter Olympics. The 20-year old Kleppen also fell on his second jump, but this skier from Telemark reached the age of 100 on 16 March 2007.

In the first round, the 19-year old Pole Wojciech  Fortuna, with good help from the wind, made the ski jump of his life, landing at 111.0 m, a new hill record. The jury discussed for a while, and then decided to continue without re-starting the competition. The Japanese home heroes were still in contention for medals. The newly crowned Olympic Champion from the Normal Hill, Yukio Kasaya, was in second place, and Akitsugu Konno and Takashi Fujisawa were in sixth and seventh place with possibilities to advance further in the second round.
The second round ended with the closest competition in the history of Olympic ski jumping. All the four Japanese failed, with Kasaya dropping from second to seventh with a jump of 85 m. Fortuna made a rather mediocre 87.5 m jump, but was still in the lead with a total of 219.9 points with only a few jumpers left. The Finn Tauno KÃ¤yhkÃ¶ produced a good jump of 100.5 m under the difficult conditions but ended closely behind Fortuna, scoring 219.2 points. The young Swiss Walter  Steiner, lying in 13th place after the first round,  made the best jump of the round, 103.0 m, and almost everybody expected him to take the lead, but no, his final points of 219.8 being 0.1 behind the fortunate Fortuna. The last challenger was East German Rainer Schmidt, in eighth place after the first round. After a good jump of 101.0 m, the second longest of the round but with mediocre style points, he ended with 219.3 points, beating KÃ¤yhkÃ¶ with 0.1 but 0.6 behind Fortuna.

Away from the Finn the picture was not so clear as the expected challengers from Norway, Austria and East Germany had faltered on the smaller hill and others, notably Pavel Ploc and his Czechoslovak teammates, had excelled where the more favoured failed. 
Strong winds meant that the competition had to be postponed on four occasions but when it was eventually held NykÃ¤nen first jump of 120.5 m was the longest ever recorded in Olympic competition and virtually ensured that he would win the gold medal. The strong Norwegian tradition was upheld by Erik Johnsen who finished second a week after placing 41st in on the normal hill. Just 0.2 of a point behind Johnsen was MatjaÅ¾ Debelak, the first Yugoslav ski jumper to win an Olympic title.
Dead last was the eccentric Briton Eddie âThe Eagleâ Edwards who narrowly avoided the embarrassment of scoring half the points of the penultimate finisher. It needs to be pointed out though that the next-to-last jumper, Todd Gillman of Canada, had fallen on his second jump.
The stories of Eddie Edwards and Matti NykÃ¤nen have come together and moved apart over the decades. The fame gained by their Olympic appearances was exploited to the point where both men reached the top of the Finnish pop charts but financial problems were to haunt them throughout the nineties. This is where the stories part company. Eddie Edwards recovered from bankruptcy, became a qualified lawyer and shares his time between the law, the building industry, his wife and children and the celebrity circuit. NykÃ¤nen life spiraled into alcoholism and violence and in 2004 he was convicted of assault when he stabbed a friend after an argument over a finger pulling competition. Married five times NykÃ¤nen has also served prison time for domestic violence and at one point was reduced to working as a stripper.

Not only was Bredesen the world champion in this event but he had also won the pre-Olympic test event and entered the Olympics as Norwegian national champion. His main rivals included World Cup holder Andi Goldberger of Austria and a resurgent Jens WeiÃflog who had won an Olympic title a decade earlier in Sarajevo. Not present in Lillehammer were the two men who had shown dominance in Albertville. Martin HÃ¶llwarth and Toni Nieminen were still teenagers in 1994 but had already suffered a collapse in form which left them out of their respective national teams.
The large and vociferous crowd was thrilled by the leap of Espen Bredesen in the first round as he sailed into the distance before coming to earth at the 135.5 m mark. This gave him a healthy lead at the half way point but gathering behind were his two great rivals Goldberger and WeiÃflog. The second set of jumps changed everything. It wasnât that Bredesen performed badly, merely that WeiÃflog was magnificent as he produced a leap eleven metres ahead of his rival and became the first German to win this event since 1960.  Jens WeiÃflog was the only winner from Sarajevo to repeat in Lillehammer and it came after his career stalled as he failed to adapt to the new demands of the V-technique and the post-unification German coaching system.

The first round showed some excellent jumping. Kankkonen made the longest jump of the day, 95.5 m and had a 4.2 points lead over Engan, who did 93.5 m. Dieter Neuendorf was third, only 0.7 points ahead of the bronze medal winner from the Normal Hill, Torgeir BrandtzÃ¦g.
In the second round, with reduced runway length, Engan again made a stylish jump at 90.5 m. Kankkonen equalled Engan distance, but was penalized for a bad landing and was 1.8 points behind Engan. BrandtzÃ¦g advanced into bronze medal position after a 90 m jump, and was almost ten points ahead of the rest of the field. Engan, Kankkonen and BrandtzÃ¦g were all in a position to take the gold medal.
In the third round, the speed was again reduced. BrandtzÃ¦g, jumping first of the favorites, improved with another good jump at 87 m, but could not catch Engan and Kankkonen in the total points and had to settle for his second bronze medal. Engan, seemingly nervous, made a total miss at 73 m, but was still in the lead. Kankkonen had to make an 87-88 m jump with decent style points to pass Engan in the fight for the gold medal. The Finn made another excellent jump at 88 m, and seemed to have full control, but just after the landing he lost his balance and touched the snow with one of his hands. The jump was judged as a fall, and Engan had his revenge.
Engan was Norway first Olympic ski jumping champion in 12 years, and the Norwegians were back again as a major force in ski jumping. However, both Engan and BrandtzÃ¦g had short careers after their 1964 Olympic success. Later in 1964, during training two days before the Holmenkollen competition, BrandtzÃ¦g had a bad fall, while jumping 10 m longer than the hill record, and was severely injured. This fearless jumper tried a comeback the year after, but in spite of winning the national Large Hill Championships he felt he was not able to regain his former strength, and therefore decided to quit at the age of 23. After his great 1964- season Engan had two rather disappointing seasons. He was on the Norwegian 1966 World Championship team, and ended his career by coming 10th in the Large Hill Competition at the World Championships in Holmenkollen.

The home crowd certainly had reasons to expect a memorable day sport. The enigmatic Masahiko Harada held the world title at this event, Four Hills champion Kazuyoshi Funaki had already won a silver medal at these Games and the two other Japanese jumpers, Okabe and Saito, were also talented performers. The man who threatened to spoil the party for the hosts was the jumper who had already won on the smaller hill, Jani Soininen of Finland.
Whilst the Japanese occupied three of the first six places, the half way lead was taken by the 21-year-old Austrian Andreas WidhÃ¶lzl, who had already impressed in taking third place in the K-90 competition. In sixth place, but apparently out of medal contention after the first round, was Harada but his second round leap was a monster. His jump was so long that he landed outside the range of the electronic measuring device and had to be measured manually. The competition could not wait and the last five jumps were taken before Harada score was processed. With the crowd at a fever pitch Funaki stepped up to take his jump and sailed out to 132.5 m and into the lead. Funaki also scored perfect 20.0 on style points from all five judges, the only time this has occurred at the Winter Olympics (through 2010), and one of only five times this has been accomplished in international ski jumping.
Soininen produced a respectable but not huge leap and could not overhaul Funaki.
Second-placed Okabe failed to leap within ten metres of his first attempt and slumped down the leader board, which left only WidhÃ¶lz between Japan and Olympic gold.  The Austrian dropped well short of the required distance and a great cheer came from the home supporters as Funaki was recognized as champion. A few seconds later confirmation came that Harada giant leap had catapulted him into the bronze medal position.

Aged 19, he had won at Holmenkollen in 1957 and 1958, and in 1959 he won the Four Hills Tournament, a prestigeous series of four competitions in Austria and Bavaria, inaugurated in 1953. For the 1960 tournament Recknagel and his fellow East German jumpers were denied visas from the West German authorities, and in his absence Max Bolkart from Oberstdorf, the venue for the first competition in the tournament, was the overall winner. Six weeks later those two would both be members of the joint German team for the Winter Olympics.
Finland best ski jumper was considered to be Juhani KÃ¤rkinen, World Champion on his home ground of Lahti in 1958. The Soviet Union had produced several top jumpers over the last few years, the stars being the 28-year-old Nikolay Kamensky, winner at Holmenkollen in 1958 and the colorful Georgian Kâoba Tsâakadze. Norwegian jumpers were still having trouble adapting to the new aerodynamic ski jumping technique, but a new generation of young athletes were closing the gap to the world top class. Ole Tom Nord, aged 19, won the 1960 National Championships and was among the future hopes.
Helmut Recknagel made an impressive first jump of 93.5 meters and was in a clear lead after the first round. The youngest man on the Finnish team, 19-year-old Niilo Halonen, was in second position followed by Kamensky and KÃ¤rkinen. The 30-year old US ski jumper Ansten Samuelstuen, Norwegian born from Lillehammer and a recently naturalized US citizen, surprised the home crowd by lying in fifth place.
In the second round, Recknagel again produced the longest jump and was unchallenged for the Olympic title. Halonen made another good jump and won the silver medal by a clear margin. Austrian Otto Leodolter made the second best jump of the last round and advanced from sixth to bronze medal position. TorbjÃ¸rn Yggeseth, educated as a fighter pilot in Canada and starting as a competitive ski jumper relatively late, advanced from eighth to fifth position with a good second jump and restored some of the lost Norwegian pride.
Helmut Recknagel was the first Olympic ski jumping champion from outside the Nordic countries. He and his fellow East German ski jumpers in the late 1950-ies developed a new aerodynamic technique by stretching their arms forward during their jumps, in Germany called âthe Superman Poseâ. Recknagel was later educated as a veterinary surgeon and for several years was a member of the East German and German Olympic Committee.

He was joined on the 1932 Norwegian ski jumping team by his brother Birger, who won the world championship in 1931, at only 19. Hans Beck, also a Kongsberg jumper and still only 20, and 19-year-old KÃ¥re Walberg from Hamar completed the Norwegian team. It was a young team with lots of ski jumping talent. It is interesting to note that three of the four jumpers on the US team were born in Norway, Roy Mikkelsen also having been born in Kongsberg.
The lack of snow created big problems for the organizers, but due to strong efforts by driving snow into the jumping hill from locations higher up in the Adirondacks the ski jumping competition was organized as scheduled.
Beck made a perfect jump in the first round, 71.5 m., five meters longer than Birger Ruud in second place, and had a clear lead. Kongsberg-born Mikkelsen from the USA made a great effort, but was not able to land his 68.0 m. jump cleanly, fell and was injured, and had to withdraw from the second round. The Swede Sten Eriksson was in third place with a 65.5 m. jump, closely followed by Walberg, Sigmund Ruud, the winner of the Nordic combined jump competition Fritz Kaufmann, and the main US hope after Mikkelsen fall, Caspar Oimoen.

The usually strong Norwegian team consisted of defending champion Birger Ruud; the bronze medalist from 1932, KÃ¥re Walberg; Reidar Andersen, three-time World Champion; and the 21-year-old, but not so merited Kongsberg-jumper, Arnholdt KongsgÃ¥rd. The Swedes had great hopes for Sten Eriksson (SelÃ¥nger), bronze medalist in three World Championships: 1931, 1933 and 1934. Eriksson had clearly beaten Ruud in a competition two weeks before the Olympics, and the Swedes felt they had good reasons for their optimism. Among the Middle European jumpers, a 22-year-old Polish jumper from Zakopane, StanisÅaw Marusarz, had shown promising things during the training jumps, and the Japanese jumpers impressed in the training sessions with long, brave and far more aerodynamic jumps than their European and North American colleagues. The landing was the big problem for the Japanese jumpers, many of their impressive jumps ending with a fall.
The huge crowd was to watch one of the closest competitions so far in the history of ski jumping. Eriksson had the longest jump in the first round (76.0 m.) and had a narrow lead over Ruud (75.0 m.), with Wahlberg in third position followed by the Finn Lauri Valonen (winner of the jumping event in the Nordic Combined earlier in the week), Andersen, Kongsgaard, Marusarz, Masaji Iguro from Japan and the US jumper, Norwegian born Sverre Fredheim, also had good jumps and were in contention for medals.  Only eight points separated the leader, Eriksson, and 10th place.
Jumping first of the favorites in the second round was Walberg, with a 73.5 m. jump he took a clear lead. Then the 21-year old Japanese Tatsuta impressed the crowd with the longest jump of the day, 77.0 m., but as in his first jump, it ended with a fall. Nobody was able to match Walberg until start number 34 Ruud was ready. The defending champion was really a man for the big events. He produced the most stylish jump of the day, one meter longer than Walberg, and took the lead. Next was first-round leader Eriksson, who equaled his first jump of 76.0 m., but with a less style points he fell 1.5 points short of beating Ruud. Next of the favorites was Andersen, fifth after the first round. An excellent jump of 75.0 m. brought him ahead of Walberg and into the bronze medal spot. Last of the favorites was Marusarz, the Polish outsider. A good length, 75.5 m., brought him from 7th to 5th place in the final classification. Ruud had defended his gold, and Eriksson had taken the first ski jumping Olympic medal for Sweden.
The young German team did well, placing 10-12-17-18; in a team competition they would have been beaten only by the Norwegians. Tragically enough, only a few years later all of them would be dead, victims of World War II.

With high style notes he was in a clear lead, 7.7 points ahead of  the East German silver medalist from the normal hill, Jochen Danneberg.

Bernd Eckstein from East Germany, lying fifth after the first round, took an early lead with a jump of 91.5, but Wallner brought the lead back to Austria with 92.5 m. Then Bachler jumped 91.0 m, bettering Wallner total points by 0.5, and Austria now held the first two spots. But Henry GlaÃ countered back for Eastern Germany. Lying tenth after the first round, he produced the best jump of the round with 97.0 m. The gold medalist from the normal hill, Hans-Georg Aschenbach, disappointed with 89.0 m, placing fifth to that point. Everybody eyes were then focused on the young Innauer. He jumped 91.0 m, a little disappointing to the crowd, but due to his excellent first jump, he brought the lead back to Austria. Danneberg was next, but he could only jump 89.5 m and was behind both Innauer and GlaÃ. The last of the favorites to jump was Schnabl, third after the first round, seven points behind Innauer. Could he secure an Austrian double? The 21-year old from Villach did. After copying GlaÃ length and style points, he won the gold medal, beating Innauer by 1.9 points. The Austrians had countered back, won a double and, with the other jumpers placing fourth and fifth, had their revenge on East Germany. The German quartet placed 3-4-7-8, meaning that the top eight placements were taken by jumpers from Austria and East Germany, a feat still unique in the history of ski jumping. Schnabl and Innauer ended their successful season by taking another double at Holmenkollen, this time with the best East German Danneberg a distant seventh.

But the event produced a surprise winner, the 21-year old Vladimir Belousov from Leningrad fought a close duel with RaÅ¡ka and had the best and longest jumps in both rounds, 101.5 and 98.5 m. Belousov became the first Soviet ski jumper to win an Olympic gold medal. The silver medalist from the 1966 Large Hill World Championships in Holmenkollen, the Japanese Takashi Fujisawa, was second after the first round, but could not control his nerves and missed totally on his second jump, ending in 18th place. RaÅ¡ka made two good jumps and ended in the silver medal position, only 1.9 points behind Belousov. Those two were in the class of their own. The bronze medalist, Norwegian Lars Grini was 17 points behind the winner.
Belousov ended his successful Olympic season with a victory in Holmenkollen one month later. In 1969 he won his only Soviet Championship, and in 1970 he had another Holmenkollen victory after placing sixth at the World Championships on the Normal Hill in Vysoke Tatra.

For the first time in a big international competition five judges would give style points, and the highest and lowest style points were deleted. The old system included three judges, and all scores counted.
The Norwegian skiers had experienced a lot of disappointments during the 1948 Winter Olympics. Their Nordic Combined and Cross Country skiers had been able to win only one medal, bronze in the cross country relay. High expectations lay on the ski jumpers, but the Finnish, Swedish and US jumpers had impressed in the training sessions and the competition was expected to be tough.
The Norwegian team was originally selected to be AsbjÃ¸rn Ruud, the youngest of the Ruud brothers, winner at Holmenkollen in 1946 and national champion in 1946 and 1948; Georg Thrane from Asker Skiklubb, winner at Holmenkollen in 1947, Petter Hugstedt, unmerited in international competitions but like the Ruud brothers also representing the famous ski jumping club Kongsberg IF. The fourth man on the team, Thorleif Schjelderup from Oslo, came second to AsbjÃ¸rn Ruud at Holmenkollen in 1946. The double Olympic champion from 1932 and 1936, Birger Ruud, now aged 36, was also a member of the Norwegian team as a substitute and assistant coach. Late in the evening before the competition, the Norwegian team leaders decided to withdraw Thrane in favor of Birger Ruud, certainly after pressure from the organizers and FIS. Birger had impressed with excellent training jumps, he was extremely popular in Middle Europe, and his elder brother Sigmund was chairman of the FIS Jumping Committee. Thrane, who was informed of the decision at ten oâclock in the evening, was shocked by the message and his relations with the Ruud brothers were rather bad in the following years.
In the first round of the competition, the 20-year old Finn Matti PietikÃ¤inen made an impressive jump of 69,5 metres and was in the lead, followed by Hugsted, Birger Ruud and Schjelderup. US jumper Gordy Wren jumped 68 metres, the second best in the first round, but lower style points placed him behind the three Norwegians. In the second round all the Norwegians jumped well. Hugstedt had the longest jump of the day, 70 metres, with 3x19.0 for his style points. Birger Ruud again showed his strong competitive instincts by taking the silver medal, and Schjelderup made the day perfect for the Norwegians by taking the bronze medal, only 0,5 points ahead of PietikÃ¤inen. 
Hugstedt was never able to win at Holmenkollen or to win a national championship title. He won the international competition in Lahti, Finland 1947, and also the open US and Canadian Championships in 1949. After placing seventh in the Lake Placid World Championships 1950 he ended his jumping career. Matti PietikÃ¤inen had his only Olympic appearance in 1948, but eight years later he was crowned World Champion in ski jumping in Falun, Sweden.

Touchon,"The Norwegian team for the ski jumping event consisted of two jumping specialists, Narve Bonna and Jacob Tullin Thams, and the two great allrounders, Einar Landvik (considered as Norway best style jumper) and the triple gold medallist Thorleif Haug. Haug was not considered to be among the four best of Norway ski jumpers, but his place on the team was given in honour of his great allround abilities as a skier.
The only serious contender against the Norwegian supremacy was considered to be the Norwegian-born US jumper Anders Haugen, known for his long and daring jumps but also for his rugged style and unstable landings.
In the first round Thams with start number 3 took the lead with a jump of 49 m, ahead of Bonna (47,5) and Haugen (49), Haug lying 4th with 44 m with superb style marks. In the second round Thams produced another 49 m jump with better style points than in his first. Haugen made the longest jump in the competition, 50 m, but was again penalized with low style points for his landing. Haug made 44,5 with even better style marks than in first round. Bonna was the last of the favorites to jump, and he equaled Thams 49 m but was not able to beat his countryman Thams in the total points. Another clean medal sweep for the Norwegians, gold to Thams, silver to Bonna and bronze to Haug, Haugen given 4th place and the 4th Norwegian Landvik in 5th.
After the conclusion of the event, some jumpers made an exhibition for the enthusiastic audience, jumping with top speed. Thoralf StrÃ¸mstad, silver medallist in both in the 50 km and in Nordic Combined, made 57,5 m, the longest jump so far in the history of ski jumping. His mark was equaled later in the exhibition by Thams and Bonna.
Almost 40 years later, the aforementioned StrÃ¸mstad contacted Norwegian ski historian Jacob Vaage, claiming that the points from the ski jumping event for Thorleif Haug had been miscalculated, and that his final points should be behind Haugen. Vaage checked the case and had to agree with the 77-year-old StrÃ¸mstad. In 1974 IOC decided to award the bronze medal to Haugen, at that time an elderly gentleman of 86. He was invited to Norway, and at a nice ceremony Haug bronze medal from 1924 was handed over to Haugen by Haug youngest daughter. Thorleif Haug himself died already in December 1934 from pneumonia at the age of 40. But Haugen was pleased to meet some of his Norwegian competitors from 1924: Narve Bonna, Einar Landvik and not to mention Thoralf StrÃ¸mstad, the man responsible for justice being made after 40 years.

After the first round Germany and Japan were separated by less than a point but Jinya Nishikata and Takanobu Okabe performed well in the second round and with one man left for each nation Japan held the advantage. By the time Masahiko Harada stood at the top of the jump he knew what he had to do to ensure a Japanese victory. A jump of around 105 m would be enough and since he had made a leap of 122 m in the first round this appeared to be a relative formality. Instead the jump turned into a disaster as he mistimed his leap and landed at just 97.5 m. One of the defining images of the 1994 Games is of Harada kneeling in the snow with head in his hands as his team-mates stood in disbelief. Prior to 1994 only the best three jumps of each team counted per round but the rules were changed before Lillehammer and all jumps were now added to the team score. If the old rules had still been in place Japan would have recorded a clear victory.

Austria, the most successful team since this event was introduced in 1988 with three gold medals, had former Olympic medalist Heinz Kuttin as their national coach. They had a disappointing season going into the Olympics, however, and were only regarded as outsiders for a medal. All the favorites had former Austrian ski jumpers as national coaches: Alexander StÃ¶ckl for Norway, Werner Schuster for Germany and another former Olympic medalist, Stefan Horngacher, for Poland.
Norway went into the lead with their first jump by Daniel-AndrÃ© Tande, and extended their lead after their second jump, performed by Andreas Stjernen. They held the lead for the remainder of the competition, despite excellent jumps from Germany anchor man, Andreas Wellinger and Poland Kamil Stoch.  After the first round Norway had a 2.0 points lead over Germany, with Poland also close, a further 3.0 points behind. Austria was a distant fourth, 52.2 points behind the leaders and with Slovenia a further 1.3 points behind.  In the second and final round, Tande and Stjernen extended Norway lead over Germany before the two final jumps from Johann AndrÃ© Forfang and Robert Johansson secured the gold medal with a final winning margin of 22.8 points. Before the last jump, Germany was only 0.1 points ahead of Poland, but Wellinger produced a stylish last jump for Germany and secured the silver medal, 3.3 points ahead of the Poles.  Austria was able to hold on to fourth place ahead of Slovenia, but they were 120.1 points behind the winning Norwegian team.

Unsurprisingly the Austrians were in a class of their own and both statistically and literally soared ahead of their opposition.

Nieminen exhilarating performance made up for the greater consistency of the Austrians though the margin of victory was a miniscule 1.5 points in a competition where the winning team scored 644.4 points.  Martin HÃ¶llwarth silver medal was his third of these Olympic Games.

With Germany last man Martin Schmitt to jump the calculations were that he would need a distance of around 124 m to win the gold for his team but he landed a half metre short at 123.5 m and everything would depend on his style marks.
Eventually the scoreboard flashed up that Germany had clinched the title by the minimum possible margin of one tenth of a point.

Teams from Germany, Norway, Japan and Poland, with double individual gold medal winner Kamil Stoch, were considered strong medal contenders.
In the first round of jumpers, Anders Bardal set the early lead for Norway with the longest jump of 137.5 m. However, the rest of the team could not meet the high expectations and they fell back to sixth place overall. Germany and Austria proved to be the most consistent teams with Marinus Kraus landing a 136.5 m jump and Thomas Diethart a 136.0 m jump, respectively, as their top athletes in the first round gave Germany a narrow lead of 2.5 points, with Japan in third place just 11.5 points behind. For Poland, Stoch was not enough and the team was already a disappointing 30 points behind after the first jump.
The first Austrian in the second round of jumps, Michael HaybÃ¶ck brought his team into the lead with a jump of 130.0 m compared to Andreas Wank 128.0 m for Germany. With Marinus Kraus scoring 132.0 points for a jump of 134.5 m, Germany reduced the margin to just 0.3 points, even though Austria Thomas Morgenstern earned 129.9 points for a jump of 133.5 m. Kraus, who did not make it into Germany team for the normal hill individual event, was their best performer, as the only jumper in the competition to record the best jump in his group in both rounds. After the third set of jumps Germany took the lead again because Andreas Wellinger outperformed Diethart by 3.7 points. Austria last jumper Gregor Schlierenzauer jumped 132.0 m for a score of 131.4 points. But Germany Severin Freund responded by jumping 131.0 m. This was good enough for Germany to hold onto the gold medal with a score of 1,041.1 points compared to Austria 1,038.4, the closest ever margin in this event. Germany became the first team to win a third Olympic team title after Lillehammer in 1994 and Salt Lake City in 2002. The silver was Austria first medal in men ski jumping at Sochi, ending their long dominance in the team event. For Schlierenzauer and Morgenstern it was their fourth Olympic medal.

Halfway through the first round all was going well for Japan. Okabe and Saito had put the Japanese into lead and next it was the turn of world champion Harada to jump, but Harada effort turned into an unmitigated disaster, and even caused his team to be subtracted points from their total. Austria, Germany and Norway would all overtake Japan and fill the first three places as the first round closed. During the interval between the two rounds snow fell and it seemed possible that the second round might be cancelled and Austria would be crowned champions. To the relief of the home fans the weather improved and the event continued. The pattern for the second set of jumps mirrored the first and Japan gained back points from their opening jumpers. When Harada stood at the top of the hill for his second jump the title was again within his team reach. As his nation collectively held their breath he came down the ramp, leapt and then hung in the air for an eternity, landing only at 137.0 m to equal the Olympic best set minutes earlier by Okabe. This gave Japan a clear lead with only a distance of 90.5 needed by Funaki to ensure victory. Funaki leap of 125 m was the cue for wild celebrations and considerable relief for the home team.

Her withdrawal left the field wide open, with Roxana CocoÈ of Romania, runner-up at the most recent World Championships, and Huang Shih-Chun of Chinese Taipei, the reigning Asian Champion, in the best positions to win the crown.
The top score in the snatch competition, 115 kg, went to three participants, Rim Jong-Sim of North Korea, Anna Nurmukhambetova of Kazakhstan, and Dina Sazanovets of Belarus, none of whom had medals from a major international tournament. In the clean and jerk, Marina Shkermankova, also of Belarus, took an early lead with a lift of 135 kg that tacked on to her 113 kg lift from the snatch. She was quickly passed by Sazanovets and Nurmukhambetova, who each added 136 kg to their total, giving the Belarusian the advantage as the lighter competitor. CocoÈ then joined them with 138 kg lift and, with an even lower body weight, moved into the gold medal position. Next came a string of failures at the 140 kg level, with Nurmukhambetova and Meline Daluzyan of Armenia, European Champion in 2007 and 2008 and runner-up in 2010, both unable to lift the weight, exhausting the Kazakh remaining attempts and leaving her in third place. Shkermankova, meanwhile, was successful at this weight and passed the Romanian, but was quickly bested by her compatriot, who lifted 141 kg. Rim then arrived with a successful lift of 142 kg, securing her lead, while Daluzyan got one final shot at the podium by attempting this weight. She was unsuccessful and thus failed to post a score. Next up were CocoÈ and Shkermankova, who lifted 143 kg to tie Sazanovets and enter the silver and bronze medal positions respectively by virtue of bodyweight. This is where they would remain, with CocoÈ failing at her 146 kg attempt and Rim succeeding with hers, thus earning the title of Olympic champion.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected. Every women weightlifting event at the 2012 London Olympics, except flyweight (â¤ 48 kg), was affected by positive re-tests.
In October 2016 the third- and fourth-place finishers, Belarussians Marina Shkermankova and Dina Sazanovets, were disqualified after positive re-tests for anabolic steroids. The bronze medal was re-assigned to Kazakh lifter Anna Nurmukhambetova. Then in November 2020, after re-testing of samples from London. Romania silver medalist Roxana CocoÈ samples produced an anti-doping rule violation (ADRV) and she was disqualified, removing her silver medal. In June 2021 Colombia Ubaldina Valoyes was advanced to third-place and scheduled to receive a bronze medal; however, because Nurmukhambetova was by then serving a suspension for use of PEDs, she was not advanced to the silver medal, leaving two bronze medals in this event (as of June 2021).

In December 2017 it was announced that Russian Oksana Slivenko would be upgraded to the gold medal, while the silver medal was re-assigned to Colombian Leydi Solis, and the bronze medal to Abir Abdulrahman of Egypt.

Liu won the gold medal in Athinai quite comfortably with the best lift in both the snatch and clean & jerk, breaking her total world record with 275.0 kg. Her clean & jerk, recorded as 152.5 kg, was actually 153.0 kg for another world record.

Doping concerns helped leave Zhazira Zhapparkul of Kazakhstan, the 2014 and 2015 runner-up, as the only other recent World Championship medalist in Rio, while Armenia Nazik Avdalyan and Great Britain Rebekah Tiler, first and third respectively in 2016, were the only recent European medalists.
Xiang and Zhapparkul posted the best results in the snatch portion, with 116 and 115 kg respectively, while Egypt Sara Samir, the reigning African and Arab champion, positioned herself in third with a lift of 112 kg. In the clean and jerk, Xiang lifted 145 kg in her second round and, although she failed to lift 147 kg in her third try, Zhapparkul, who had struggled to post 140 kg, did not attempt to catch up. This assured Xiang the gold medal and Zhapparkul, who successfully lifted 144 kg, secured silver. Samir had lifted 143 kg, which would have given her silver had Zhapparkul failed at 144 kg, but instead she settled for bronze. This made Samir the first Egyptian woman to receive an Olympic medal (Abir Abdulrahman retroactively received silver from the heavyweight weightlifting division at the 2012 Summer Olympics after the three medalists from that event were all disqualified for doping concerns, and later received bronze in the light-heavyweight division of the 2008 Games for similar reasons) and the first Egyptian to win an Olympic weightlifting medal since 1948 (with the same caveat as above).

Ties broken by lightest bodyweight.,na,"While the four lightest women weight classes moved up by only 1 kg after Rio, the higher categories saw bigger changes, with the light-heavyweight class being increased by 7 kg up to 76 kg. This also made a gap of 12 kg of bodyweight between middleweight (64 kg) and light-heavy, but that was also due to the fact that, unlike the World Championships, a 71 kg class was not contested at the Olympics.
The two dominant athletes in the 76 kg class, Rim Jong-Sim and Zhang Wangli (CHN), season best 263 kg, did not participate in Tokyo. The two-time Olympic gold medallist Rim was out of the Games as PRK decided not to send a team to the Olympics due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and Zhang missed the Games as China could only send four female lifters to Tokyo and she was left out of the squad. Rim was the reigning world champion from 2019, and Zhang won the last Asian championships held in April 2021. Both had also been world record holders, with Rim in snatch (124 kg) and total (278 kg), and Zhang in clean & jerk (156 kg). No other lifter in this category at Tokyo had set a world record. Also missing was Leidy SolÃ­s, qualification best 256 kg and reigning world champion in the 81 kg class, after she was cut from the squad when the Colombian Weightlifting Federation was sanctioned due to the high number of doping offences. The top athletes present in Tokyo were Neisi Dajomes, season best 261 kg, Aremi Fuentes, qualification best 250 kg, Iryna Dekha, season best 248 kg, Kim Su-Hyeon, season best 244 kg, and the reigning 71 kg world champion Kate Nye, who lifted 248 kg in that event.
After three valid lifts in snatch, Dajomes had a solid lead with 118 kg. She was followed by Dekha with 113 kg, Nye with 111 kg, Fuentes with 108 kg, and Kim with 106 kg. In clean & jerk, Dekha failed to clear 131 kg three times and was out of the competition before the other medal contenders had even started their attempts. The next to finish was Fuentes, with a best lift of 137 kg for a total of 245 kg, which was good enough for second place at that time, but she was overtaken by Nye with her next lift of 138 kg for a total of 248 kg. Dajomes lifted 135 kg, and later improved to 140 kg and 145 kg to secure the gold medal. Meanwhile Kim failed to lift 138 kg and while trying to go for bronze also missed twice at 140 kg, which left her without a valid lift in clean & jerk.
The Olympic Standard for Olympic records was 121 kg for snatch, 149 kg for clean & jerk, and 270 kg for total. None of these records were broken at in Tokyo.
Dajomes, who enjoyed a perfect competition with six valid lifts, became the first Olympic weightlifting medallist for Ecuador, the first female Olympic medallist for Ecuador ever, and only the third Ecuadorian athlete to win an Olympic medal in history. It was also the third Olympic gold medal for Ecuador after 20 km walker Jefferson PÃ©rez in 1996, and cyclist Richard Carapaz eight days earlier at the Tokyo Games. Nye won the fourth Olympic weightlifting medal by an American woman, while the US men have been waiting since 1984 for a medal. Also, Fuentes won the fourth Olympic weightlifting medal by a woman for Mexico, while the Mexican men have never won an Olympic weightlifting medal. Finishing ninth in this event was Mahassen Fattouh who became the first ever female Olympic weightlifter for Lebanon after qualifying via the Asia Continental Ranking.

Ties broken by lightest bodyweight.,na,"After two days of rest, the weightlifting competition continued with the men light-heavyweight class (up to 81 kg). China had already won the first three men events in Tokyo and, as only four athletes per gender were allowed to compete, this was the last men event with a Chinese athlete entered and it was ex Olympic champion Lu Xiaojun. He had won gold in 2012 and silver in 2016, when beaten only by bodyweight in the 77 kg class. Lu, the winner of many titles, was the back-to-back world champion, winning at the last two editions in 2018 and 2019. He was also the reigning Asian champion, winning the title in April 2021, and was also the world record holder in clean & jerk (207 kg) and total (378 kg). His strongest opponent was his compatriot Li Dayin, who was almost 15 years younger. Li was the Asian champion in 2019 and World Championship runner-up in 2019 and was also the world record holder in snatch (175 kg), set at the last Asian Championships. Due to the one athlete per nation rule, however, Li did not compete in Tokyo, and it was Lu who was selected. The challengers to Lu for gold were Antonino Pizzolato, season best 370 kg, and winner of the last two European championships, Brayan Rodallegas, season best 363 kg and winner of the last two Pan American championships, ZacarÃ­as Bonnat, season best 360 kg and second at the last two Pan American championships, and RejepbaÃ½ Rejepow with a qualification best of 363 kg.
After the snatch element, Lu led with 170 kg followed by Pizzolato (165 kg) and Rejepow (164 kg), who both failed to improve their results when they failed their last lifts. As Rodallegas also failed with his last attempt, he finished fourth together with Bonnat and Ritvars Suharevs who all lifted 163 kg. Lu started the clean & jerk element with a solid 197 kg lift, Bonnet followed with a 198 kg, and Pizzolato and Harrison Maurus both lifted 200 kg. Rodallegas missed his last attempt over 200 kg, which left him without a medal. Bonnat was able to clear 202 kg and then 204 kg, which gave him 367 kg in total and brought him to second place. Lu had previously also cleared 204 kg for a clear lead. When Maurus failed to lift 205 kg in his last attempt the bronze medal was already secured by Pizzolato, so he tried to go for gold with the new world record weight of 210 kg, but he did not make it. Lu also tried this weight, but also failed.
The Olympic Standard for Olympic records was 168 kg for snatch, 201 kg for clean & jerk, and 365 kg for total. Lu set the only Olympic record in snatch with 170 kg, while in clean & jerk Bonnat first set the Olympic record with 202 kg, for it only to be bettered by Lu with 204 kg. New in total Olympic records were set by Lu with 367 kg and 374 kg.
Lu became the first Chinese weightlifter to win three Olympic medals and also became the oldest ever Olympic weightlifting gold medallist at 37 years 4 days. He was almost a year older than Rudolf Plyukfelder, who won gold back in 1964. With the fourth gold medal for the Chinese men weightlifting team they finished unbeaten in Tokyo. This was the first time that a men weightlifting team had won four gold medals since 2008, when it was also China, but with six lifters competing. The last time a men weightlifting team won more gold medals was in 1992 when the Unified Team won five golds, with ten starters. Also competing in Tokyo was Amur Al-Kanjari who got a Tripartite Commission Invitation to become the first Olympic weightlifter representing Oman.

The silver medal eventually went to German Eugen Deutsch who was initially disqualified for missing all three snatches, but on appeal, the jury reinstated one of his snatches which moved him into second place, to the consternation of the non-German competitors. Haller would win the 1937 World Championship in this class, defeating Hostin, who took silver. In 1938 Haller was second and Hostin third to American teenager John Davis, who after the war, would win seven straight heavyweight titles in the Worlds and Olympics (1946-52).

Samadov had also recently won the 1992 Europeans, in a close contest with Pyrros Dimas of Greece and Poland Krzysztof Siemion. Dimas was a native Albanian who competed for that nation at the 1990 European Championships but had emigrated to Greece in 1991 with his brother, and was granted Greek citizenship almost immediately.
The event turned out to be one of the closest in Olympic history. Samadov, Dimas, and Siemion all tied with 370.0 kg, with Siemion moving up with the best clean & jerk of 205.0 kg. Dimas and Siemion both weighed 81.80 kg, while Samadov weighed 81.85 kg, which dropped him back to the bronze medal. In a new weightlifting rule, first used at the 1992 Olympics, the tie between Dimas and Siemion was broken by whichever lifter posted the final total first. This was Dimas, who lifted 202.5 kg in the clean & jerk, before Siemion hoisted his 205.0 kg. Dimas would become one of the greatest lifters ever in the next few years, winning this class again at the 1996 and 2000 Olympics, and winning a bronze medal in 2004.
So the podium seemed set, with Dimas first, Siemion second, and Samadov third, but Samadov was not happy. He was known to be high-strung and a perfectionist and at the medal ceremony, he refused to lean forward to receive the bronze medal. He then took it in his hand and dropped it onto the podium and walked away. The IOC was incensed and disqualified Samadov, leaving the bronze medal position open. He apologized the next day, but the ruling stood, and the International Weightlifting Federation banned him for life.

He had to dress, warm-up, and hurry out to the platform, and he failed badly on the final attempt, as the Soviet officials continued to argue that his previous lift had been clean. After all the arguing, the podium positions were Lomakin 1st, Stanczyk 2nd, and Vorobyov 3rd. Vorobyov would move up in class and win gold as a middle-heavyweight in 1956 and 1960.

The two tied at the 1995 Worlds, but Dimas won on lower bodyweight, so this was expected to be a close contest between the two. However, when Dimas snatched a world record 180.0 kg, he made it very difficult for Huster, who was 10 kg behind. Both lifted world records of 212.5 kg, as Dimas defended his gold medal with a total of 392.5 kg. At Sydney, the two would renew their rivalry with the same result, but in 2000 they would tie on total weight, Dimas winning his third gold medal because of lower bodyweight.

They had placed 1-2 in 1996 and at the 1998 World Championships, and were 2-3 at the 1999 Worlds, when they were upset by Iranian Shahin Nassiri Nia. Dimas had won this gold medal in both 1992 and 1996.
Nassiri Nia went out early in Sydney when he dislocated his shoulder on his first snatch attempt. Dimas missed his first two snatch attempts, but then succeeded on 175.0 kg, below his goal of 185, which left him trailing Huster, who had lifted 177.5 kg. The leader after the snatch was Georgian Giorgi Asanidze with 180.0 kg. When Dimas lifted 215.0 kg in the clean & jerk, this gave him 390.0 kg, a total matched by Huster and Asanidze. The medals were decided on bodyweight, with Dimas weighting 84.06 kg, Huster 84.22 kg, and Asanidze 84.70 kg.
Dimasâ third Olympic weightlifting gold medal equalled the mark set by Turkey Naim SÃ¼leymanoÄlu in 1988-96, although it would later be equalled in Sydney by Dimasâ teammate Akakios Kakiasvili, and in 2004 by Turkey Halil Mutlu. Only Dimas and SÃ¼leymanoÄlu won their three gold medals in the same class. Dimas returned in 2004 and won a bronze medal in the light-heavyweight class, his fourth Olympic weightlifting medal equalling the mark set by American Norb Schemansky (1948-64) and German Ronny Weller in Sydney (1988-2000), but Dimas is the only Olympic weightlifter to win four medals in the same class.

Instead, it was going to be Rostami vs Tian Tao of China, with Denis Ulanov, the 2016 Asian champion and 2012 Olympian Yoelmis HernÃ¡ndez, Cuba vying for a spot on the podium.
After a slow start and coming desperately close to being eliminated, Tao recovered on his third snatch, after two fails. Then he missed his first two clean & jerks too, bringing back memories of the 2015 World Championships when he missed all three attempts, having led after the snatch. Thankfully, Tao rallied and made things tough on Rostami (who had set two world records earlier in the year), setting an Olympic record for the clean & jerk (217 kg) and total (395 kg), before Rostami took it from him with a 217 kg clean & jerk, and breaking his own total world record of 395 kg with a 396 kg, to capture the gold medal. The self-coached Rostami gave Iran their first gold medal of the Rio Olympics. Tao won the silver with a 395 kg total despite making only two of his six lifts.
Romania Gabriel SÃ®ncrÄian, who had the same total as Ulanov at 390 kg, secured the bronze by virtue of lightest body weight. On October 13, 2016, it was reported by the International Weightlifting Federation that SÃ®ncrÄian had tested positive for excess testosterone in a doping test at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games and he was disqualified.

Rybakov lifted 209.0 in the snatch, but when Lu apparently lifted 214 kg on his second attempt, he seemed to have the gold medal, tying Rybakov with 394.0 kg, but Lu weighed less than Rybakov. The Chinese officials started celebrating but the judges then ruled that the lift was not legal. Lu made his third attempt with the same weight and this time cleanly lifted 214.0 kg and the gold medal was his. Bronze went to Armenia Tigran V. Martirosyan, whose teammate and namesake, Tigran G. Martirosyan (no known relation), had also won a bronze medal in the lightweight class in Beijing. Rybakov competed again in this class at the London Olympics, attempting to finally win his gold medal, but he failed to complete a clean lift and was eliminated.

He returned, attempting to become the first man to win four Olympic weightlifting gold medals, but it was not to be. The early leader was Belarussian Andrey Rybakov, who was so unheralded that he had lifted in the B group in the afternoon. Lifting that night, gold went to Georgi Asanidze of Georgia, the 2001 World Champion and 2002 European Champion. Asanidze lifted 177.5 kg in the snatch, trailing Rybakov 180.0 kg, but his clean & jerk of 205.0 kg brought him the title as Rybakov won an unlikely silver.
Dimas held on to win the bronze medal, making him only the fourth weightlifter to win four Olympic medals, after American Norb Schemansky (1948-64), German Ronny Weller (1988-2000), and Bulgarian/Croatian Nikolay Peshalov (1992-2004), who had won his fourth medal earlier in Athinai.

He was not the only favorite, however, with snatch and total world record holder Andrey Rybakov of Belarus, twice World (2006 and 2007) and once European Champion (2006) and two-time Olympic silver medalist returning in the hopes of finally capturing the crown. Also in the mix were Kianoush Rostami of Iran, reigning World Champion and runner-up in the last two Asian Championships, his compatriot Sourab Moradi, twice Asian Champion (2009 and 2012), and Raul Tsirekâidze of Georgia, the reigning European Champion.
Moradi and Rybakov were eliminated in the snatch portion, failing to lift 166 kg and 175 kg respectively in three attempts, with Rybakov upping his weight to 180 kg in the final try. 175 kg alone would have been sufficient to take second place in the snatch, matching Apti Aukhadov lift, but ranking higher based on his lower bodyweight. Aukhadov, a Russian, had been the runner-up at the 2011 European Championships and was behind only Lu lift of 178 kg. Coming in third with 174 kg was Adrian ZieliÅski of Poland, 2010 World Champion and 2011 bronze medalist.
In the clean and jerk portion, 205 kg seemed to be a key weight. Yoelmis HernÃ¡ndez of Cuba, 2010 Pan American Champion and reigning Pan American Games Champion went first and successfully brought himself into second place behind Ivan Markov of Bulgaria, who had only lifted 203 kg thus far, but had the fourth-best score, 172 kg, in the snatch. Tarek Yahia of Egypt, a 2010 world bronze medalist in the middleweight division, then matched the weight and positioned himself above the Cuban, before Aukhadov lifted the same weight and moved into first place. Lu, meanwhile, surprisingly failed three times in a row to lift the weight and was thus eliminated from the competition. ZieliÅski at first looked to be going the same way, failing at his initial attempt at 206 kg, but boosting himself into first place after a successful second lift. Rostami came out at 209 kg to tie ZieliÅski and Aukhadov in total lift and move into gold medal position by virtue of his lighter weight. Markov, now outside of the medals, was unable to respond and lost his chance of making the podium. HernÃ¡ndez also failed, at a weight of 210 kg, but Yehia and Aukhadov succeeded, bringing them into fourth and first places respectively. ZieliÅski followed with a successful lift of 211 kg, tying the Russian score and pushing into the gold medal spot with his lower body weight. Aukhadov attempted to respond with a 212 kg lift but failed, leaving him with nothing to do but wait and see if he would retain his silver medal after Rostami and Yahia final lifts. The Iranian went first, attempting 214 kg to tie ZieliÅski and Aukhadov (and win by body weight), but failed twice and remained in third place. Yehia tried to lift 216 kg, which would have given him not only the bronze medal, but the Olympic record as well, but was unable to do so, leaving him in fourth.

But this class in Rio was loaded with World and Olympic medalists, all capable of winning Olympic gold, including World champions Aline Focken of Germany (2014 at 69 kg), Alina Stadnik of Ukraine (2013 at 67kg), and Jenny Fransson of Sweden (2012 at 72 kg) who like Vorobyova, had dropped in weight. Other previous World and Olympic medalists offering a serious challenge included China Zhou Feng (2015 silver behind Vorobyova, winner of the 2016 Test Event in Brazil, and was ranked No. 1 entering the Olympics), Japan Sara Dosho (2014 silver, and bronzes in 2013 and 2015), Canada Dori Yeats (2012 World silver, plus 2014 Commonwealth Games and 2015 Pan American Games champion), Ochirbatyn Nasanburmaa of Mongolia (2008, 2011, 2013 World bronzes), and Agnieszka Wieszczek-Kordus of Poland  (2008 Olympic bronze).
In the end, it was Dosho vs Vorobyova for gold. Dosho scored a two-point takedown in the final minute of the match to bring the score from 2-0 to 2-2. Because Dosho two-point score was better than either of Vorobyova one-point scores, Dosho won the match on criteria, thus dethroning the reigning Olympic and World champion. Dosho gold medal was the third of the day for Japanese women in wrestling, as her countrywomen Eri Tosaka and Kaori Icho had won their respective weight classes in dramatic finishes. Of the 18 gold medals awarded in the sport since women wrestling joined the Olympic program, Japan has won 11 of them.
Sweden Jenny Fransson, who had suffered losses in three World Championship bronze medal bouts, and who had lost to Dosho in the Rio semi-final, made history when she became the first ever Swedish woman to win an Olympic wrestling medal defeating Canadian Dori Yeats 2-1.
The other bronze medal match saw Enas Mostafa become the first ever Egyptian woman to reach a wrestling semi-final, but lost to Kazakhstan Elmira Syzdykova, 7-4, dashing hopes of winning her country third medal of the Games.

ÅÉrifov and Lashgari were drawn in the same half and met in the semi-finals, where the Azerbaijani managed to edge out the Iranian in three rounds for a chance at the gold. In a comparatively weaker top bracket, Marsagishvili was thought to be a cinch to survive to the finals, but was defeated in the quarterfinals by Jaime Espinal of Puerto Rico. Espinal was the most recent Central American and Caribbean Games Champion and won one round against each of his opponents by at least six points in his successful journey to the gold medal match. In the final, however, ÅÉrifov was unquestionably the dominant wrestler, winning the rounds 6-1 and 2-0 to give Azerbaijan its second gold medal of the competition â and the day â following ToÄrul ÆsgÉrov victory in the lightweight division.
In the first bronze medal bout, Marsagishvili faced rookie Soslan Gattsiyev of Belarus and was heavily favored to win. The Georgian asserted his dominance with a quick takedown in the first 10 seconds of the starting period that he was able to convert into a total of three points to capture the round. He was victorious in the second period by only a slightly less margin, 3-1, and easily won the bronze. For the final podium spot, Lashgari battled Ä°brahim BÃ¶lÃ¼kbaÅÄ± of Turkey, the 2010 Mediterranean Champion, and was favored for the medal. The Iranian outscored the Turk 3-2 in an aggressive first round, but BÃ¶lÃ¼kbaÅÄ± lost steam in the second period and was unable to answer the three points Lashgari scored on him to claim the bronze.

En-route to the final bout in the 86 kg class, Sadulayev had not given up one single point in the Olympic tournament, outscoring three early opponents 28-0. In his semi-final bout against ÅÉrifov, Sadulayev, known as the âRussian Tankâ, gave up one single point, beating ÅÉrifov 8-1 (the only point won against him the entire Olympic tournament).
Considered to be the best pound-for-pound wrestler alive, Sadulayev, who entered the Olympic Games undefeated since 2013, met YaÅar in the gold medal match - a repeat of the 2015 World Championship final in Las Vegas, won by Sadulayev. Yasar had advanced to the final after beating American Cox 3-1.

Nonetheless, it was expected that Marinov and Janikowski would be the most serious challengers for the crown.
In the end it was not to be â Marinov, Selimau, and Avluca were all eliminated in their first bout, Avluca by Janikowski and Selimau by eventual finalist Alan Khugayev of Russia, runner-up at the most recent European Championships. Janikowski survived to the semi-finals, where he was defeated by Gaber, who went on to face Khugayev in the finals. Both rounds of the gold medal match went to par terre, with Khugayev emerging victorious after a successful defense, and then gut-wrench, of his Egyptian opponent.
In the first bronze medal match, Daniyal Gadzhiyev of Kazakhstan, a rookie wrestler who had managed to defeat Marinov in his first bout and Selimau in the repÃªchage, and Vladimer Gegeshidze of Georgia, an unusually tall competitor for his weight class who had not seen the podium in his two World Championships. They were evenly matched in their first two rounds, each successfully defending in the par terre, while, with points and cautions tied 90 seconds into the third round, Gadzhiyev drew the top and Gegeshidze the bottom in the final par terre. During the round, it seemed at first that the Georgian had won, scoring two points by converting his defense. The Kazakhs protested and, in a controversial decision, the referee call was overturned and Gadzhiyev was awarded the point and, consequently, the bronze medal. Gegeshidze, seemingly a fair sport at first, refused to shake hands with his opponent and attempted to exit the arena the wrong way, before kicking at the barricades and storming off. The second bronze medal match, between Janikowski and MÃ©lonin Noumonvi, a three-time Olympian and runner-up at the 2009 World Championships, was far less dramatic, with Janikowski successfully defending in the first par terre and throwing his opponent out of the ring in the second to clinch the bronze.

But the main story behind Silva were her origins in the notorious favela (slum) Cidade de Deus (City of God) in Rio. It was there that the 2004 Olympic bronze medalist FlÃ¡vio Canto founded a martial arts school which was to turn Silva into the world top judoka in her class. The 24-year-old was not really a surprise victor as she was the 2013 World Champion and a two-time gold medalist at the Pan American Games. However, prior to the Olympics she had dropped to 14 in the rankings. Silva had competed in London 2012 where she was disqualified for an illegal leg grab against Hedvig Karakas of Hungary. In Rio the two met again in the quarter-finals. This time, Silva scored a Waza-ari (half point) after 1:50 min, which proved to be sufficient to advance to the semi-final. After beating the second seed, Korean Kim Jan-Di, earlier in the tournament, in the final Silva faced the top-seeded Asian Champion Dorjsurengiin Sumiya. Again, an early Waza-ari for a Sumi-otoshi (corner drop) was decisive in winning gold.

China entry in the 2012 Olympic tournament was Li Xueying, 2009 World Champion and 2011 runner-up. There was also a possibility of a challenge from Pimsiri Sirikaew of Thailand, bronze medalist at the most recent World Championships, but Novikova and Li were strongly favored for the crown.
With a lift in the snatch of 108 kg Li bested the Olympic record set by her compatriot Chen Yanqing, winner of the last two gold medals in the event, and placed herself in an advantageous position for the clean and jerk portion. Yuliya Kalina of Ukraine, bronze medalist at the 2009 World Championships and 2009 European runner-up, came in close second with 106 kg while Boyanka Kostova of Azerbaijan, reigning European Champion and a world silver medalist in the featherweight in 2010, managed 105 kg. With lifts of 103 and 100 kg respectively, Novikova and Sirikaew fell to joint-fourth and joint-ninth.
Already ahead of the competition, Li began the clean and jerk with a greater weight than anyone else, successfully lifting 133 kg on her first attempt. This weight (or lower) eliminated most of her challengers, including Novikova and Kostova, the latter of whom failed at her first attempt with 124 kg and only managed 128 kg in the end. Kalina too only managed 129 kg, but this had been good enough for gold until she was dethroned by Li. Rattikan Gulnoi of Thailand then lifted 134 kg, four above her personal best, to enter the bronze medal spot. She was quickly kicked out by her teammate Sirikaew, however, who lifted 136 kg to enter the silver medal spot, a feat that Gulnoi could not reproduce. Already ahead, Li made her lead virtually unreachable by lifting 138 kg to set an Olympic record for total points and tying the clean and jerk one, again stealing these honors from Chen. Sirikaew attempted 140 kg in an attempt to break the clean and jerk Olympic record while Li attempted to break the world one with a 144 kg lift and, although both were unable to accomplish their feats, neither went home empty handed.

The first of them was the women lightweight class, contested up to 59 kg, after being held up to 58 kg from 2000-16. The clear favourite was Kuo Hsing-Chun, who won a bronze medal in the 58 kg class in Rio, but since then she had been unbeaten, winning world titles in 2017 (58 kg), 2018, and 2019, as well as winning the Asian Championships in 2017 (58 kg), 2019 and 2020 (held in 2021). Furthermore, she was the world record holder in snatch (110 kg), clean & jerk (140 kg), and total (247 kg). She achieved the snatch and total record shortly before the Olympics in April 2021. The snatch world record was previously held by Choe Hyo-Sim, but she did not compete in Tokyo due to the renouncement of PRK. China former clean & jerk world record holder Chen Guiming, and Luo Xiaomin, second in the season ranking with 227 kg, and silver medallist at the last Asian Championships, were not present as this was one of the three weight classes China had chosen to meet the determination of only four female athletes per nation. Consequently, this was the first weightlifting event in Tokyo with no Chinese competitor. Not present in Tokyo also were Janeth GÃ³mez, season best 220 kg, and Rosive Silgado (COL), and Taylor Wilkins (USA), both with a season best of 217 kg. This gave medal chances to Yusleidy Figueroa, season best 218 kg, HoÃ ng Thá» DuyÃªn, qualification best 223 kg, and Alexandra Escobar with a qualification best of 220 kg.
When Kuo started her snatch attempts all other athletes had finished and there had been some surprises. HoÃ ng, known as a good snatcher, lifted only 95 kg, which put her behind Polina Guryeva and Dora TchakountÃ©, who both cleared 96 kg, while Escobar failed to set a valid attempt when she missed 95 kg three times. A good performance was shown by Mikiko Ando clearing 94 kg, while Figueroa cleared 91 kg, but she was better at clean & jerk. Kuo finally lifted 103 kg for a comfortable lead. In the clean & jerk Guryeva lifted 119 kg in her second attempt to put her in the lead. When HoÃ ng missed 119 kg twice, and TchakountÃ© missed 120 kg, a weight that was cleared by Ando in her third attempt, the Japanese moved into second place. Only Figueroa was still fighting for a medal but she missed 125 kg. Kuo cleared 125 kg in her first attempt, which gave her the gold medal, with Guryeva taking silver and Ando bronze. Finally, Kuo tried to lift 141 kg in her last attempt. It would have been a new world record, but she failed.
The Olympic Standard for Olympic records was 102 kg for snatch, 127 kg for clean & jerk, and 229 kg for total. All three were achieved by Kou, who cleared 103 kg and 133 kg for a total of 236 kg.
The silver medal won by Guryeva was the first ever Olympic medal for Turkmenistan. The gold medal won by Kuo was the fourth Olympic gold medal for Chinese Taipei in weightlifting, their most successful sport at the Olympics, and all their gold medals had been won by women, one at each of the last four Olympics. The bronze medal for Ando was the only weightlifting medal for the host nation in Tokyo. Escobar competed in her fifth Olympics to become the third woman to do so, only three days after Hiromi Miyake and Dika Toua achieved that feat. Also competing in this event was the first ever weightlifting competitor at the Olympics for Botswana, but as Magdeline Moyengwa failed to set a valid lift in clean & jerk she was unplaced.

The final was described in one source as âcomplicated.â RodrÃ­guez had the lead early, but twice countered with kosoto-gari. They then began to accrue penalties for passivity. Finally, RodrÃ­guez went to the mat, appearing to injure his ribs. Bandaged by the Cuban doctor, he fought back to take the lead, and the match went the duration. At first, the referee mistakenly awarded the title to Jang, who jumped up in to the air in jubilation. But the mistake was quickly corrected, as RodrÃ­guez won the first Cuban judo gold medal.

Ties broken by lightest bodyweight.,na,"The second day of the Olympic weightlifting competition saw the second men event contested. It was the first time since 1992 that two weight classes had been held on the same day. This weight class was for lifters up to 67 kg, almost equal to the 67.5 kg of the historical lightweight class contested between 1920 and 1992. In the field of 14 lifters was Chen Lijun, season best 333 kg, a four-time world champion 2013 and 2015 (62 kg) and 2018-19 (67 kg). He was also the Asian Championships winner in 2019 and 2020 (held in April 2021). At the 2019 Asian Championships he also set world records in snatch (154 kg), clean & jerk (185 kg), and the still-standing record in total (339 kg). The snatch world record was bettered by Huang Minhao (CHN), season best 332 kg, with 155 kg at the Olympics Test Event in Tokyo later in 2019, and the clean & jerk world record, which Chen improved to 187 kg, was bettered by Pak Jong-Ju with 188 kg at the 2019 World Championships, but both Huang and Pak did not compete at the Tokyo Games. Huang missed the Games because every nation could only nominate one athlete per weight class, and Pak was not present because PRK did not send a team due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The remaining challengers to Chen were Luis Javier Mosquera, season best 330 kg, bronze medallist from Rio (69 kg) and 2020 Pan American champion (held in 2021), Muhammed Furkan Ãzbek, season best 323 kg, gold medallist at the 2021 European Championships and 2021 Junior World Championships, Mirko Zanni, qualification best 320 kg, runner-up at the 2021 European Championships, and Adkhamjon Ergashev, qualification best 328 kg, 2019 Junior World champion, bronze medallist at the last Asian Championships, and second best qualifier for the Tokyo Games in the ranking list on points.
Chen and Zanni both lifted 145 kg in their first snatch attempts, but both were not able to improve in their next two attempts as both failed to lift weights of 150- and 151 kg, respectively. This opened up the competition for others with Mosquera having already lifted 148 kg in his first snatch. Han Myeong-Mok and Talha Talib, who only got a place on the Tripartite Commission Invitation a few weeks before the Games, both lifted 147 kg in their second attempts. When Mosquera cleared 151 kg and Talib, known as a good snatcher, did the same with 150 kg in their last attempts, they finished first and second after the snatch followed by Han (147 kg), Chen, and Zanni (both 145 kg). The first of the medal contenders to finish his clean & jerk was Talib who lifted 170 kg in his last attempt for a total of 320 kg. He had already caused some drama after collapsing on the stage shortly after missing his first attempt over 166 kg due to short of breath. He soon recovered after medical staff supported him and he went on for another two lifts, and both were successful over 166 kg and 170 kg. Zanni failed to lift 172 kg in his first attempt and Han failed 174 kg in his second. When Han lifted 174 kg in his last attempt for a total of 321 kg, Zanni had to go for 177 kg to overtake the Korean. The Italian failed in his second attempt, but managed to clear 177 kg in his last attempt for a total of 322 kg, winning bronze with only two good lifts in this competition. In between, both Mosquera and Chen lifted 175 kg, which secured the former at least a silver medal. After a missed attempt at 180 kg, it looked as though Mosquera cleared this weight with his last lift, but the attempt was given invalid as he dropped the bar before the siren. This was reviewed by the jury and finally it was given as a good lift as he always had control over the weight. This gave him a total of 331 kg, putting pressure on Chen, who now had to go for 187 kg, 12 kg more as in his first attempt and only one kilogram short of the world record, to win gold. Still competing was Ergashev, who tried to lift 184 kg, which would have been good enough to win bronze, but he failed twice. So, the last athlete to perform was Chen, down in fourth place and out of the medals, he had two more attempts to lift 187 kg. He needed only one as he was successful in his first attempt, totaling 332 kg. After being down 6 kg after the snatch, he won gold by 1 kg.
The Olympic Standard for Olympic records was 151 kg for snatch, 181 kg for clean & jerk, and 328 kg for total. The best snatch in this competition was by Mosquera with 151 kg, but as the standard had to be improved by at least 1 kg this did not count as Olympic record. In clean & jerk, Chen set an Olympic record with 187 kg, and in total, first Mosquera set the Olympic record with 331 kg, only to be bettered by Chen with 332 kg.
This was the third weightlifting gold medal for China at the Games, so China was still unbeaten. Winning two weightlifting gold medals on the same day made China the first nation to do so since 1960 when Viktor Bushuyev and Aleksandr Kurynov both won gold for the Soviet Union on the same day. If counting the 69 kg class as precursor of this weight class, China has won the last five gold medals in this event. Silver was the second medal for Mosquera, but the first time he stood on the podium as his bronze medal in 2016 only came after being upgraded following a doping case. The bronze medal of Zanni for Italy, who already won the first weightlifting medal for Italy at the Youth Olympics with bronze in 2014, was the first weightlifting medal for that nation since Norberto Oberburger won gold back in 1984. Talib, the first Olympic weightlifter competing for Pakistan since 1976, placed fifth to give his country the best ever weightlifting result in history. Their last Olympic medal in any sport was back to 1992, when the men hockey team took home bronze.

However, Militosyan outlifted him in both the snatch and the clean & jerk to win the gold medal.

They were tied after the snatch at 135.0 kg, along with France Daniel Senet. Kaczmarek then lifted 172.5 kg in the clean & jerk and the gold medal was seemingly his. However, he tested positive in doping controls for an anabolic steroid, the exact identity of which was never announced, and he was disqualified.

When Mousbah also led the clean & jerk with 145.0 kg, he and Fein tied with world record totals of 342.5 kg, breaking the mark of 337.5 held by Mousbah. As there was no tie-breaking method in place in 1936, Fein and Mousbah both received gold medals. Mousbah never competed internationally again, and labored in anonymity as Egyptian radio failed to announce that he had won a medal. He was forced to carry around his gold medals for years to prove to people that he won it. Fein won a silver medal in this class at the 1937 World Championships, trailing Tony Terlazzo, who won the featherweight division in Berlin.

The early lead was taken by Frenchman RenÃ© Duverger, runner-up to Haas at the 1930 European Championship. In the snatch Duverger extended his lead, and he won the gold medal quite easily, in a major upset.

The B group, which usually consisted of weightlifters outside of the world top ten, set an unusually high bar for the event. Junior SÃ¡nchez of Venezuela, the 2011 Pan American Games silver medalist, lifted 148 kg in the snatch, a mark that was bested by only three competitors in the A pool.

Lin won the snatch portion of the competition with a lift of 157 kg, five kilograms more than his nearest competitor, RÄzvan Martin of Romania, who had been runner-up at the last two European Championships. Binay came in third with a 150 kg lift, while Bayramov was eliminated after failing to lift 142 kg in three attempts. Martin became the first person to surpass Kim and SÃ¡nchez in total points by lifting 177 kg in his first attempt at the clean and jerk. Binay attempted to be the next by lifting 180 kg, but failed on both attempts and was left out of the running for a medal, while Martin successfully lifted the weight and increased his lead by 3 kilograms. Lin then succeeded in his attempt at 182 kg, placing him well above Martin thanks to his impressive snatch performance. With no realistic hope of surpassing Lin, Martin attempted a 182 kg lift that failed, while Lin extended his lead with a successful try at 187 kg. In between Indonesia Triyatno, twice World Championship bronze medalist (2009 and 2010) and third-place finisher at the 2008 Olympic Games, lifted 186 kg to guarantee himself a podium spot. Triyatno seemed to have reached his limit at that point, but managed the best lift of the tournament with 188 kg to pass Martin and take the silver medal. For his final lift, Lin attempted to break the world record with 198 kg and, although he was not successful, he certainly went home a champion.
Those results stood until November 2020, after re-testing of samples from London. Romania RÄzvan Martin samples produced an anti-doping rule violation (ADRV) and he was disqualified, removing his bronze medal. At the end of 2020, no adjustments have been made in the medal standings for this event. In June 2021, by decision of the IOC Executive Board, Kim Myong-Hyok was advanced to the bronze medal position.

Another contender was the 2015 World bronze medalist and 2016 European champion DaniÃ½ar IsmaÃ½ilow of Turkey, and Kim Myong-Hyok of Korea, fourth at the 2012 Olympic Games, was the third man to be amongst the favourites for a medal. Based on being named the outstanding lifter at the 2016 Pan American Championships, where his total of 336 kg was more than IsmaÃ½ilow âs 333 kg winning lift at the European Championships, Bredni Roque, a former Cuban, competing for Mexico, was considered a serious outsider with a medal chance.
A lot of lifters were going bold with their starting weights in the snatch, which resulted in Ketut Ariana of Indonesia bombing out early. Kim, failed with all his clean and jerk attempts. LuÃ­s Javier Mosquera of Colombia took the lead with three lifters remaining, setting a new personal best at 155 kg, but Shi was on a mission, and IsmaÃ½ilow was not going to make it easy. After a 162 kg snatch, Shi clinched the gold medal with a 190 kg clean & jerk for a 352 kg total, holding off the challenge by IsmaÃ½ilow (formerly of Turkmenistan) who made six good lifts and lost the gold by just one kilo. Shi attempted an Olympic record in the clean & jerk, but was unsuccessful.
With this Olympic win, Shi became an Olympic champion just like the man whose name he was given when he was a teenager. At that time, his coach, two-time Olympic champion Zhan Xugang, renamed him after the elder Shi Zhiyong, the 2004 Olympic champion and national hero.
IsmaÃ½ilow, who had finished 13th at the 2012 Olympic Games, took home the silver medal. Izzat Artykov who first entered international competition in 2010 in the lightest category (56 kg), and whose strength had improved enormously over the years, won the bronze medal with a 339 kg total.

Japan looked to continue its dominance in the sport on day two, this time with Saori Yoshida in the 55 kg division, a competitor whose record was formidable. She had won the event in every World Championship, Asian Games, and Olympic tournament since 2002 and, as the sport had been introduced at the Olympics only in 2004, this meant she was the only Olympic champion. She met Canada Tonya Verbeek in the final, runner-up at the 2004 Olympics and the most recent World Championships and bronze medalist at the 2008 Games and the 2005 and 2009 World Championships. In the final, however, Yoshida was simply the better wrestler, outscoring her opponent 3-0 and 2-0 to claim her third Olympic crown.
The first bronze medal bout was perhaps the most evenly matched of all the medal rounds, pitting Tetiana Lazareva of Ukraine, whose best international finishes were gold at the 2001 and 2002 European Championships and silver at the 2000 and 2008 World Championships, against Jackeline RenterÃ­a of Colombia, winner of her nation first Olympic wrestling medal with a bronze from 2008 to add to her victory at the 2007 Pan American Games. Lazareva made it to the bronze medal match by defeating Geeta Geeta of India in the repÃªchage round, whose presence was notable as the first Indian competitor in Olympic women wrestling. In the bronze medal match, Lazareva took an early lead by scoring one point in the first round to win it but, in a scoreless second period, was unable to convert her advantage in the par terre to points.

The final podium spot was all but a foregone conclusion, with 2009 World and 2011 European Champion in the non-Olympic 59 kg class Yuliya RatkeviÃ§ of Azerbaijan facing rookie Valeriya Zholobova of Russia. RatkeviÃ§ was also the runner-up in the lightweight division of the 2010 World Championships and the advantage of her experience was immediately evident as she scored six points on, and nearly pinned, Zholobova before the first round was over. In the second period, each was able to shove the other out of the ring for one point, but the Azerbaijani scored a final point in the last ten seconds and earned her bronze medal.

Her 189 consecutive match-winning streak was finally broken in January 2016 by Mongolian wrestler PÃ¼revdorjiin Orkhon, who had the best chance to dethrone the Olympic champion based on recent history, despite being world-ranked No. 7, coming into Rio.
Also in the hunt to prevent Icho from her place in history, were Petra Olli of Finland (world-ranked No. 1 in 60 kg) who lost to Icho at the 2015 World Championships, and Valeriya Koblova of Russia (world-ranked No. 2 in 58 kg, right behind Icho), who lost in the final to Icho at the 2014 World Championships.
En-route to the Rio gold medal final, Icho won two matches by technical fall, and gave up only a single point in her other match. However, in the final against the Russian Koblova, she found herself trailing late in the match, behind 2-1. Then, with five seconds left on the clock to make Olympic history, Icho was awarded a two-point score, and dramatically won 3-2.

The Russian, however, arguably had the stronger opponents, having to get through GÃ³mez, Dutt, and Iran Masoud Esmaeilpoor, the 2010 Asian Champion and 2012 runner-up, on his way to the gold medal match. In the final, however, it was ÆsgÉrov who was surprisingly dominant, winning the first round with a single point and scoring three points in the first fifteen seconds of the second period. An extra two points by the end were superfluous, as the Azerbaijani unseated the World Champion and earned the Olympic crown.
The first bronze medal match was contested by Kenichi Yumoto of Japan, a bronze medalist at both the 2008 Summer Olympics and the most recent World Championships, and Coleman Scott of the United States, a rookie on the international scene. The pair were evenly matched at first, leading the first round to a par terre in which Yumoto drew the advantage and was able to convert it into a point. In the second period Scott reversed a leg hold to score two points on his opponent, which rose to three following an unsuccessful challenge from the Japanese coaches. Yumoto then scored the first point in the final round, but Scott came back in the final fifteen seconds to score three points and take the medal. For the final podium spot, it was Dutt against Ri Jong-Myong of North Korea, whose best international finish was third at the 2011 Asian Championships. Both competitors looked strong at first, with Ri and Dutt winning the first and second rounds respectively by one point. By the end of the final period, however, Dutt had scored six unanswered points against Ri, clinching the bronze.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the events affected, in a sense.
In December 2013, Russian silver medalist Besik Kudukhov was killed in a car accident after colliding with a truck. In October 2016, his samples from the 2012 London Olympics were re-tested and came back positive for turinabol (dehydrochloromethyltestosterone). Because he was deceased, and had no chance for an appeal, no change in the result standings, nor the medals, was made.

There were several strong competitors able to challenge for the bronze medals, but most observers foresaw Norouzi and Aliyev battling in the final, as they had ended up in opposite halves of the draw.
Norouzi struggled slightly with China Sheng Jiang in the opening round, but moved on and quickly asserted his dominance on his way to the final.

It was Iran second Olympic title in Greco-Roman wrestling, the first having come only one day earlier with Hamid Soryan victory in the featherweight division.
In the first bronze medal match Æliyev was unable to defend against an onslaught from Zaur Kuramagomedov of Russia, a 2011 World Championship bronze medalist. Converting two rounds of par terre wrestling into points, Kuramagomedov was able to keep the former World Champion Azerbaijani off the podium. The contest for the second bronze medal was fought between Almat Kebispayev of Kazakhstan, runner-up at the 2011 World Championships and bronze medalist at the 2010 edition, and Ryutaro Matsumoto of Japan, silver medalist at the 2010 World Championships. The two were evenly matched and ferocious, each winning a round, before Matsumoto was able to get the best of his opponent and pin him, winning the bronze medal with the only fall of the event.

Points on the last sprint doubled.,na,"This was the Olympic dÃ©but for Madison racing, named because it was originally pioneered at the Madison Square Garden in New York. The Madison is a mass-start event comprising teams of two riders per team.  It is similar to a team points race, as points are awarded to the top finishers at the intermediate sprints and for the finishing sprint.  Only one of the two team riders on the track is actively racing at any one time, riding for a number of laps, and then exchanging with his partner, who is propelled into the race by a hand sling from the cyclist leaving the action. World Championships had only been held in Madison racing since 1995, but it has its origins in six-day racing where it has been part of the event for many years. The Olympic distance has been 60 km. since it made the Olympic Program.
Fourteen teams came to the line. The Australian pair of Scott McGrory and Brett Aitken placed second in the first sprint and won the second sprint, moving ahead with eight early points. They continued to pile up sprint points, missing out only on the third and fourth sprints. By the 12th and final sprint, all they had to do was avoid being lapped and finish the race to win, which they did with 26 points, despite not contesting the final sprint. To do so, they had barely avoided a crash involving three teams on the ante-penultimate lap. The Belgian pair of Ãtienne De Wilde and Matthew Gilmore was in fourth place coming to the final lap, but won the finishing sprint for 10 points to move up to the silver medal. At the finish, Scott McGrory celebrated by slowing down raising his arms in triumph. As he did so, Italy Silvio Martinello moved past him for two points, which earned them the bronze medal over Great Britain.  This was Australia first track gold in 16 years. Both riders dedicated their victory to their children. McGrory had lost his 4-month old son to heart failure in 1999 while Aitken 2-year-old daughter suffered from Rett Syndrome, a developmental disorder.

It is a two-person team endurance relay, with one of the riders off the track at any one time. The race was over 200 laps for a distance of 50 km with 20 sprints (every tenth lap) and the first over the line at each sprint received 5 points, with the next three receiving 3, 2 and 1 point respectively. On the 20th and last lap, those points were doubled. If a team lapped the entire field they received 20 extra points and if they were themselves lapped, had 20 points deducted.
Denmark Lasse Norman Hansen, the team pursuit silver medallist, and his partner Michael MÃ¸rkÃ¸v were favourites for the gold medal as they were the reigning world champions. The bronze medallists from the 2020 World Championships, Germany Roger Kluge and Theo Reinhardt, were also in the field. The Germans were also the 2019 world champions. The Tokyo 2020 Omnium winner Matthew Walls of Great Britain, and partner Ethan Hayter, were also considered medal prospects.
France Benjamin Thomas and Donavan Grondin won the first two sprints but it was the British pair of Walls and Hayter who took control and were in the lead after 10 of the 20 sprints, albeit by a single point from Denmark Hansen and MÃ¸rkÃ¸v. After 14 laps, France held that same slender one-point lead over the Danes as the race was setting itself up for an exciting finish.
Going into the final sprint Denmark led with 41 points, with France on 36, Great Britain on 30. Only France could overtake the Danes but it was Britain who surged over the line first for 10 points and a total of 40. France scored just four points on the last sprint and also finished on 40 but Demark held on to gold with 43 points. Britain took the silver because they crossed the finishing line ahead of France. Denmark Lasse Norman Hansen and Michael MÃ¸rkÃ¸v now added Olympic gold to their World Championship gold while Hansen won his second medal of the Games.

The race started quite early, 2:30 PM, beneath a warm sun. The course started and finished at the Olympic Stadium, and looped out-and-back along the Han-Gang River.

Bordin and Salah were in this group, but de Castella had been distanced. At 40 km. Salah led, followed by Kenya Douglas Wakiihuri, and then Bordin.

(32Â° C.) day.  In addition it was run over dusty country roads, and the lead automobiles kicked up so much dust that the runners practically choked on it throughout the race.  There was also only one water stop on the course, that being a well at 12 miles.
Among the Americans there were several top distance runners.  Sammy Mellor, winner of the 1902 Boston Marathon; John Lordon, winner of Boston in 1903, Mike Spring, winner of Boston in 1904, and Arthur Newton, who had finished fifth at Paris in the 1900 Olympic marathon.  The top foreign distance runners were not present, but a 5-foot tall Cuban named FÃ©lix Carvajal had come to St. Louis.
Carvajal had raised money for the trip by staging exhibitions and running the entire length of Cuba.  Arriving in New Orleans, he lost all his money in a crap game, which forced him to hitch-hike to St. Louis.  He showed up on race day wearing heavy street shoes, long trousers, a beret and a long-sleeved shirt.  Martin Sheridan helped him out by trimming the pants and the shirt.  During the race, Carvajal would stop to eat some green apples and which caused stomach cramps and didnât help his cause any.  Still he finished fourth, listed in a 1905 edition of the St. Louis Republic as âabout 1/2-hour behind Hicks.â
The first two South African Olympians were, ironically, black men named Len Taunyane and Jan Mashiani who ran the marathon.  Both Tswana Tribesmen, they were present at the South African exhibit of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition.  They had been dispatch runners during the recent Boer War and were noted to be âthe fleetest in the service.â  They finished the marathon in 9th and 12th place, respectively.
The race started at 3 PM and the runners ran five laps of the stadium before heading out into the country.  Fred Lorz had the early lead, but dropped out at nine miles.  At that point, the lead was held by Arthur Newton, veteran of the 1900 Olympic marathon, and Sammy Mellor.  Shortly thereafter, Mellor slowed to a walk, and Tom Hicks moved up on the leaders.  Through 14 miles, Mellor had regained the lead, with Newton second, Hicks thirds, and Albert Coray and William Garcia together in fourth.  Garcia would eventually drop out, and suffered so badly from the heat, dust, and lack of water, that he spent several days in the hospital, his life in the balance, before recovering.
At this point, Hicks began to flag badly.  His handlers helped him, administering strychnine sulfate in an egg white, giving him water, and sponging him down.  The early sports medicine seemed to work as he had the lead at 19 miles.  At 20 miles he was again ready to collapse when he was given the same potions along with sips of brandy.  He was then passed by Fred Lorz, who was refreshed after having ridden in an automobile most of the race.
Lorz entered the stadium first and received the crowd plaudits, as they were oblivious to his scheme.  Hicks came shortly after, almost dead on his feet.  He had finished the race by slow jogging interspersed with periods of walking.  Lorz was soon found out and was banned from amateur competition for life, only to see it rescinded in time for him to win the 1905 Boston Marathon.

Still, the event was held, and incredibly, was started at the hottest part of the day, 2:30 PM.  The runners made four circuits of the 500 metre track before making out for the streets of Paris, although Johan NystrÃ¶m withdrew before one lap of the stadium.
George Touquet-Daunis led the runners out of the Bois de Boulogne.  Race descriptions are scanty, but he led through at least half the race, followed by Ernst Fast.  When Touquet-Daunis dropped out, Fast took the lead.  However, he was basically spent by that point, and Michel ThÃ©ato passed him to win by a few minutes over Ãmile Champion, with Fast finishing almost 40 minutes back.
ThÃ©ato was a baker assistant and knew the streets of Paris well from his deliveries.  Arthur Newton later claimed that ThÃ©ato and Champion must have used their knowledge of the streets to cheat as he never saw them pass him.  However, this does not explain Fast finish, nor does it agree with race reports which have Touquet-Daunis and Fast leading the early part of the race.  In the early 1990s, French athletics historian Alain BouillÃ© discovered that ThÃ©ato was actually a Luxembourgeois national.

A former track and cross-country runner at Yale, he had won the Pan-American Games marathon and the Fukuoka race in 1971, establishing him as the favorite. The race was held on the last day of the MÃ¼nchen Olympics, five days after the tragedy involving the Israeli Olympic team, which made all competitions seem meaningless. It started in the Olympic Stadium at 3 PM, and was run over an out-and-back course. Shorter won the race fairly comfortably, moving into the lead by 15 km., and was never challenged. The silver medal went to Belgium Karel Lismont while defending champion Mamo Wolde won the bronze medal.
Unfortunately, Shorter was not the first ârunnerâ to enter the Olympic stadium. A West Germany student, Norbert SÃ¼dhaus, decided to pull a prank and ran onto the Olympic course just outside the stadium. He ran around the track and was not pulled by officials until he neared the finish line. When Shorter entered the stadium, he saw SÃ¼dhaus running on the track and did not know who he was. Shorter became the third American to win the Olympic marathon, and none of them was actually the first runner in the stadium at the end of the race. In 1904, Tom Hicks won the race, but Fred Lorz, who had dropped out, hitched a car ride, and decided to run into the stadium. In 1908, Italy Dorando Pietri led the race in the last half and entered the stadium first. But he was on the verge of collapse, and though officials helped him across the line, he was disqualified for illegal assistance, allowing America Johnny Hayes to win the gold medal.

The origin of the modern marathon lies in the ancient legend of a Greek courier, normally seen as Pheidippides, but more likely actually Philippides. The primary source for the legend is the Greek historian Herodotus, who recorded the verbal history of men who had fought in the ancient battle of Marathon.
According to Herodotus, Philippides was sent to Sparta from Athens asking for help in the battle. After the battle, a runner, whose name was Pheidippides per Lucian and Eucles per Plutarch, was sent to Marathon from Athens to tell of the victory. Further details are sketchy, though modern legend has Pheidippides arriving in Athens to tell of victory in the battle with the words, âRejoice, we conquerâ, and then dying from his effort. There is little ancient documentary evidence to support that part of the tale.
The modern marathon was suggested by the Frenchman, Michael BrÃ©al, a friend of Baron Pierre de Coubertin, who accompanied Coubertin to Athens in planning the 1896 Olympics. BrÃ©al wrote Coubertin thusly, âIf the Organizing Committee of the Athens Olympics would be willing to revive the famous run of the Marathon soldier as part of the program of the Games, I would be glad to offer a prize for this new Marathon race.â  The idea was immediately accepted.
The marathon race was held on 10 April 1896, starting in the village of Marathon, with the runners covering the dusty dirt roads to Athens, a distance of about 40 kilometres. There were 17 starters, of whom 12 were Greek and 5 foreign. The race started at 1400 hours when Colonel Papadiamantopoulos fired the starter pistol.
The leader for the first 20 km. was Albin Lermusiaux of France. At about this time, the heat, the uphill grade, and the dusty roads began to take their toll, and runners began to withdraw from the race. At the halfway mark, Greece Spyros Louis was in sixth place, trailing Lermusiaux, Teddy Flack (AUS), Arthur C. Blake (USA), Gyula Kellner (HUN), and the leading Greek, Georgios Lavrentis. Blake dropped out at 23 km. and the Greek favorite, Kharilaos Vasilakos, moved into third place.
Shortly thereafter, Lermusiaux tired and Flack took the lead. Lermusiaux would eventually retire at 32 km. At 32 km. Louis caught Flack and they ran together for about five kilometres. Louis finally dropped Flack near the village of Ambelokipi, and Flack dropped out on the outskirts of Athens.
At this time, various couriers who had negotiated the course on bicycles and horses entered the Panathenaic Stadium and informed the crowd of Louisâ approach, announcing, âHellene, Hellene!â (A Greek, a Greek!)  Louis then entered the stadium, and Crown Prince Nicholas and Prince Georgios accompanied him on his last circuit. He finished and won in 2 hours, 58 minutes and 50 seconds. Vasilakos was 2nd in 3-06:03, trailed by Kellner in 3-09:35. Greece Spyridon Belokas was the original third-place finisher in 3-06:30 but, following a Hungarian protest, he was disqualified when it was found he had taken a carriage for a short part of the race. Ten runners finished, nine Greeks (including Belokas), and Kellner.

This time he was running only the marathon, but he was not as ready as in 1952, having recently had hernia surgery. The favorite mantle probably fell to the Algerian-born Frenchman, Alain Mimoun. Mimoun had won the International Cross-Country four times, and had won three Olympic silver medals on the track, always trailing ZÃ¡topek. He had also finished second behind ZÃ¡topek twice at the 1950 European Championships. Like ZÃ¡topek in 1952, he was making his marathon dÃ©but.
Mimoun dominated the race. He was always in the lead group and by 25 km. he had opened almost a minute on the field. He ran steadily from there, winning the race by 1:32 over Yugoslavia Franco MihaliÄ. ZÃ¡topek, not near his top form, finished sixth. In his wonderful book, All That Glitters is Not Gold, William Oscar Johnson relates the story as told to him by Mimoun. When he finished he waited for ZÃ¡topek to arrive. When he did, he did not at first acknowledge Mimoun, being in some distress. Mimoun then told him, âEmil, it was I who won.â ZÃ¡topek then turned around and saluted Mimoun, his close friend. Telling the story years later, Mimoun noted, âOh, for me that was better than the medal.â Mimoun ran two more career marathons, failing to finish the 1958 European Championships, and finishing 34th at the 1960 Olympics.

At 13 km., the runners ran 17 km. on an absolutely straight concrete highway, the Avusrennstrecke, before returning to the forests, to eventually end in the stadium. Six nations, Finland, Great Britain, Japan, Peru, South Africa, and the United States, entered a full complement of three runners. The Japanese team consisted of three Korean runners. After the Russo-Japanese war of 1904-05, Japan had occupied Korea, and forced their athletes to compete under the Japanese flag. They were led by Son Gi-Jeong, who was also required to race under a Japanese version of his name, Kitei Son. Son had run 12 marathons since 1933, winning nine of them, and never placing below third. In Tokyo, on 3 November 1935, he set the world record of 2-26:42, and among his 12 races, he had broken 2-30 seven times.
The race began at 3:00 PM, with the weather dry and clear, but not overly warm (22Â° C. [72Â° F.]). Son was never far from the lead and by the midway point, he and Britain Ernie Harper had moved into second and third, trailing the defending champion, Juan Carlos Zabala. But Zabala tripped and fell at 28 km. and Harper and Son passed him. He dropped out shortly thereafter. By 33 km. Son had pulled away and he eventually won the race by almost two minutes, Harper winning the silver medal.
Son was a proud Korean. When the Japanese anthem was played at his victory ceremony, he bowed his head and refused to acknowledge it. He told reporters that he was ashamed that he had to run for Japan. The next day, a leading Korean newspaper showed a photo of the victory ceremony, but covered the Japanese rising sun from his uniform singlet. For that, the Japanese jailed several of its employees and closed down the newspaper. Korea did not forget its first Olympic champion. In 1988, when Seoul hosted the Olympic Games, the Olympic torch was brought into the stadium by Son Gi-Jeong, now running proudly under the Korean flag.

The effect of high-altitude on athletic performance was known from previous competitions. In sprints and short-distance races, it produced record performances, but at distances, the thin air, with lesser oxygen content, impeded the athletes, and resulted in very slow competitions. No event in 1968 would be more affected by the altitude than the marathon.
The two-time defending champion, Abebe Bikila, was back and since he had grown up in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, at higher altitude than Mexico City, he should have been a favorite. But he was injured, having recently had an appendectomy and was running the race with a stress fracture. He would not finish. But his teammate, Mamo Wolde, had also grown up at that altitude and his track experience, which went back to the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, made him a formidable contender.
The race began at 3 PM on the final day of track & field competition, on a warm (23Â° C. [73Â° F.]) and sunny day. The course was point-to-point, starting at the Plaza de la ConstituciÃ³n, known as the ZÃ³cala, and ending at the Stadio OlÃ­mpico. The pace was slow, the runners worried about the altitude, and thru 10 km., a large group of runners led the field. By 20 km. the lead was held by Belgium Gaston Roelants, 1964 gold medalist in the steeplechase, and Britain Tim Johnston, followed closely by four runners â Naftali Temu, who a week before had won the 10 km. on the track, Wolde, JÃ¼rgen Busch (GDR), and Turkey Ä°smail AkÃ§ay. Temu then pulled ahead by 25 km., but Mamo Wolde took the lead at 30 km. He eventually won by over three minutes from Japan Kenji Kimihara, making it three straight marathon gold medals for Ethiopia.

In June he entered the Finnish Olympic trial, but announced to the official he would stop at around 40 km., because of an Achillesâ tendon problem. His time to there was just over 2-22, equivalent to about a 2-29 marathon, which would have won the race by six minutes. Nurmi made the trip to Los Angeles but did not run the Olympic marathon. Three days before the Olympics began, the IAAF suspended him for having accepted excessive expense money during some of his tours. He was declared a professional and was not allowed to compete in the Olympics.
The 1932 Olympic marathon course started and finished at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, but was a loop course around Los Angeles. The best known runners in the race were two Britons, Sam Ferris and Duncan McLeod Wright. Also highly considered was the winner of the Finnish trial, Armas Toivonen. The Americans had no top contender but interestingly, an Argentine, Juan Carlos Zabala, had run in two of the American trial races, having come to the United States to acclimate himself. In the race, a stretched-out pack of five led thru 24 miles, which included Zabala, Ferris, Wright, Toivonen, and Japan Seiichiro Tsuda. Zabala took the lead but was struggling. Ferris, in fourth, was the freshest and closed quickly as they neared the stadium. But he had not started his surge soon enough, and Zabala won on the track by 19 seconds, with Ferris second, and Toivonen third. Zabala attempted two more marathons in his career, but never again finished the race.

This change had been made even before the 2020 pandemic postponement, and it helped as Sapporo was cooler than Tokyo, but hardly ideal marathon conditions as the dew point was 22Â° C. (72Â° F.), although overcast skies did give the runners some relief.
Kenyan Eliud Kipchoge was the defending gold medalist and the heavy favorite. He had won 14 of his 16 career marathons, was the world record holder, and in a special paced race in Wien (Vienna) in October 2019, had broken the fabled 2-hour marathon barrier, although because of pacing, and other assistance, it was not eligible for world record status.
Likely because of the heat, the early miles were run at a leisurely pace, with over 30 runners together at the halfway point. At 25 km Kipchoge went to the lead and picked up the pace, and 10 runners remained with him to 30 km. At that point he challenged them, and nobody could answer. He had run a 15:07 split from 25-30 km, but Kipchoge ran the 30-35 km segment in 14:28 and the battle for gold was over, as the final 7 km loop was but a victory lap. He eventually finished in 2-08:38 to win by over a minute.
Behind Kipchoge a pack of five runners were together from 30-35 km, which included the Netherlands Abdi Nageeye, his Belgian training partner Bashir Abdi, both originally from Somalia, and Kenya Lawrence Cherono. Those three would finish almost together in a close sprint finish, with Nageeye taking silver and Bashir bronze, as Cherono trailed in fourth, only four seconds separating the three.
Kipchoge victory made him only the third marathoner to win two Olympic gold medals, after Ethiopia Abebe Bikila in 1960-64 and East German Waldemar Cierpinski in 1976-80. It was also his fourth Olympic medal as he had won bronze in the 5,000 metres in 2004, improving to silver in that event in 2008.

For four consecutive years (1971-74), he had won what was considered the top race in the world, Japan Fukuoka Marathon. His biggest competition in MontrÃ©al was expected to come from another American, Bill Rodgers, who had surprised in 1975 by winning the Boston Marathon in 2-09:55. Canada Jerome Drayton had won the 1975 Fukuoka race over Australian Dave Chettle and Rodgers. Two Japanese runners, Akio Usami and Shigeru So, were also highly considered.
But the big story in MontrÃ©al was a runner who had never before run a marathon. A last-minute entry was Finland Lasse VirÃ©n who in both 1972 and 1976 had won the 5,000 and 10,000 on the track. He entered the marathon to attempt to duplicate Emil ZÃ¡topek distance triple from 1952.
The day of the race was warm and overcast, but a drizzle at the start turned into a steady rain throughout the race. This was not good news for Shorter, who did not like to run in the rain. Bill Rodgers pushed the early pace but he was running with an injured hamstring and would eventually fall back. At 25 km. the lead group included Shorter, Rodgers, VirÃ©n, Drayton, and a little-known East German former steeplechase runner, Waldemar Cierpinski. Shorter then put in a surge, attempting to drop the field, and only Cierpinski responded. At 30 km. it was Cierpinski who surged and Shorter could not match him. He gradually pulled away and won by almost 50 seconds. Shorter won the silver medal and the bronze went to the defending silver medalist, Belgium Karel Lismont. Lasse VirÃ©n finished a respectable fifth.

The race started at 4 PM, but as it was early spring in Sydney on 1 October, the conditions were as cool as anything Olympic marathoners had seen since MontrÃ©al in 1976. There was no individual favorite, but African runners, especially those from Kenya and Ethiopia by now dominated international marathoning and road racing. In fact, the two nations had such deep world-class runners to choose from that even the make-up of their Olympic marathon teams was hard to pick in the months prior to the Olympics. The race itself was unspectacular. Defending champion Josia Thugwane ran, but finished 20th. Not unexpectedly, three runners from Ethiopia and Kenya mounted the podium. Ethiopia unheralded Gezahgne Abera won the gold medal, 20 seconds ahead of Kenya Erick Wainaina, who had won a bronze medal in 1996. Abera countryman, Tesfaye Tola, placed third. Of the 100 starters, 81 finished the race.

He came into London as the favorite, but was expected to be challenged mainly by his countrymen, Abel Kirui and Emmanuel Mutai. A surprising omission from their Olympic team was world record holder Patrick Makau. The opening pace was pedestrian, going through 10K in a 2-09:49 pace, but Kipsang then put the hammer down, running the next two miles in 4:30 and 4:36, to spread out the field, dropping Mutai. At the halfway point he had a 16-second lead on a group of six contenders. Among these were Kirui and the surprising Ugandan Stephen Kiprotich, more known as a track and cross-country runner. He had been sixth at the 2011 International Cross-Country race, and then made his marathon dÃ©but at the Enschede race, winning in his first marathon.
At 22 km, Kiprotich gave chase on Kipsang, pulling Kirui along with him, and basically settling the medal race. The two caught Kipsang at 24 km and they would remain together through 35 km. Kiprotich then dropped back slightly, seemingly injured as he slapped at a cramping left hammie. But it was possibly more a tactical pause as he surged ahead going up Fish Street Hill, and dropped both Kenyans over the next minute. He poured on a 4:42 24th mile that left him alone and Kiprotich came home to win Uganda first ever medal in the marathon, and their first Olympic gold medal in athletics since John Akii-Bua had won the 1972 400 hurdles.
Kirui attempted to run with Kiprotich but was unable to, while behind him, Kipsang gave way after setting the early pace, and he would win bronze. American Meb Keflezighi, silver medalist at the 2004 Athens Olympics, came home just out of the medals in fourth.

It was the first, and until 2016, the only Olympic marathon that neither started, nor finished at the Olympic stadium. The race started in the late afternoon and finished in the dark, the course lit by torches to illuminate the route. And it was won by a man running barefooted.
The race started at 5:30 PM at the Piazza di Campidoglio, one of Roma seven hills. The course was a triangular loop, running along many of the wonders of Ancient Roma. The course passed along the Caracalla Baths, ran down the Appian Way, and finished under the Arch of Constantine, in the dark.
The favorite was probably the Soviet runner, Sergey Popov, who on 11 October 1959, at the KoÅ¡ice Marathon in Czechoslovakia, had become the second runner under 2-20, breaking the world record with 2-17:45.2. The early lead was taken by the Belgian AurÃ¨le Vandendriessche, who had won five Belgian titles since 1956. He was joined by a small group that included Britain Arthur Keily, and two African runners, Ethiopia Abebe Bikila and the Moroccan, Rhadi Ben Abdesselam. Bikila was unusual as he was running the race barefoot. By 20 km. Bikila and Rhadi had taken the lead, and they would run together until near the stadium. At about 500 metres from the finish, at the Piazza di Porta Capena, running down the torchlit way, Bikila finally broke Rhadi and pulled away to win the race by 25 seconds. It was ironic that Bikila made his move as he passed the Obelisco di Azum, which had been brought to the square from Ethiopia after the Italian invasion of that nation by Mussolini. The bronze medal was won by New Zealand Barry Magee, with two Soviet runners following â Konstantin Vorobyov in 4th and Popov in 5th.
Bikila would return to run the Olympic marathon again in 1964, winning in world record time. By then he would be acclaimed as the greatest marathoner ever, and many experts still give him that title. In his career, he ran 15 marathons between 1959-68, winning 12 of the first 13, but not finishing his last two, which included his final race at the 1968 Olympics. He would later be severely injured in a car crash, and rendered quadriparetic, dying in the early 1970s.

Peters had run the 10K at the London Olympics but had since turned to the marathon. He had won the 1951 Polytechnic race in 2-29:24 and in June 1952, he ran the Windsor-to-Chiswick marathon, the British trial race, in 2-20:42.2, shattering the world record. In Helsinki he faced a straight out-and-back course, starting and finishing at the Olympic Stadium.
The race started at 3:28 PM on a fairly cool day. In the race, making his marathon dÃ©but, was Czechoslovakian Emil ZÃ¡topek. ZÃ¡topek had been the star of the Helsinki Olympics, winning the 5,000 and 10K on the track. He had also won the 10K at the 1948 Olympics. Although he had never run the marathon before, his presence was auspicious. As the race started, Peters took the field thru a suicidal pace for 5 km. ZÃ¡topek stayed back. Peters led thru 20 km. when he was caught by ZÃ¡topek and Sweden Gustaf Jansson. At just after two hours, Peters had to withdraw with a muscle cramp. ZÃ¡topek never looked back and gradually pulled away from Jansson to the finish, completing his remarkable distance Triple Crown with a margin of 21/2 minutes. Argentina Reinaldo Gorno passed Jansson at about 39 km. and won the silver medal, with Jansson third.

The race was very open with no strict favorite in the field. The race started at 3:14 PM on a cool, windy day, with high humidity. By 37 km. a small lead group had formed with Algerian-born Frenchman Boughera El Ouafi, Chile Manuel Plaza, American Joie Ray, Finland Martti Marttelin, and Japan Kanematsu Yamada. Ray briefly took the lead but was quickly passed and faded to finish fifth. Yamada then assumed the lead but he fell to the ground with cramps. Though he was able to get up and finish, he would finish fourth. Over the last five km., El Ouafi and Plaza opened up ground on Marttelin. El Ouafi would pull away shortly before entering the stadium and won the gold medal by 26 seconds over Plaza, with Marttelin third. El Ouafi was the first native-born African to win an Olympic gold medal. He had competed at the 1924 Olympics, but had competed very little since then. However, he served as a dispatch carrier for the French army in the war against Abdel Krim in 1926, running long distances in the desert which maintained his condition. After the Olympics, he turned professional and competed briefly in the United States.

Salazar had won the New York Marathon in 1980, 1981, and 1982, and won Boston in 1981. His 1981 New York win in 2-08:12.7 appeared to be a world record but the course, on re-measurement, was found to be slightly short of the full marathon distance. That same year de Castella won Fukuoka in 2-08:18 and that time did become a world record for the marathon. He had also won the marathon at the first Athletics World Championships in 1983. Seko would have been a favorite in 1980, but Japan joined the American boycott of Moskva, and he could not run. In 1981 Seko won the Boston Marathon, and he had won four Fukuoka titles between 1979 and 1983.
The Olympic marathon course started at Santa Monica City College and ran thru Los Angeles, finishing at the LA Coliseum on the track. The race started at 5 PM and was run in warm sun throughout. Salazar, de Castella, and Seko all came to the starting line, but none of them figured among the leaders during the race. It was eventually won by the Portuguese Carlos Lopes. Lopes had been a top 10K track runner and in 1983 had won the International Cross-Country Championship at the Meadowlands in New Jersey. He had only once before finished a marathon, that in Rotterdam in 1983. In 1985, he would return to Rotterdam and set a world marathon best of 2-07:12. The other medalists were from the British Isles, with Ireland John Treacy winning the silver medal and Britain Charles Spedding the bronze. De Castella finished fifth, Seko 14th, and Salazar 15th.

He began running the marathon seriously in 2005, and in September 2007 had broken the world record with 2-04:26 in Berlin. But he opted out of the marathon in Beijing, concerned about air quality and its possible deleterious effects on his health. This left the race wide open. The day of the race saw temperatures of 24Â° C. (77Â° F.) and high humidity, negating chances for a fast time. Kenyan Samuel Wanjiru knew the heat would make fast times difficult but had trained in the heat in Japan and was determined to set a very fast pace. He went to the lead immediately, passing 5K in 14:52, and many of the lead runners would not go with him, thinking the pace was too fast for the conditions. Wanjiru eased slightly after the opening 5K but ran in the lead throughout. At the halfway mark, he had cut the lead pack to only five runners â Yonas Kifle (ERI), Deriba Merga (ETH), Martin Lel (KEN), and Moroccan Jaouad Gharib. After 30K, only Gharib could stay with Wanjiru. But at 35K, they shared a water bottle, and Wanjiru then put the hammer down to drop Gharib, eventually winning by 44 seconds in 2-06:32, considered stunning in the heat. Ethiopia Tsegaye Kebede closed fast to get the silver medal but was almost three minutes back of Gharib. In September, Gebrselassie again broke the marathon world record at the Berlin race, running 2-03:59.

Though the European press did not realize it, the two weeks of the Atlanta Olympics were about as cool as that region of the nation ever gets in late July and August. To avoid the heat, the race started at 7:05 AM, but by the time the race ended, the temperature had risen to almost 80Â° F. (26Â° C.), with humidity approaching 80%. The Olympic course was designed to basically follow the outline of the course used for the annual Atlanta Marathon, but changed slightly to allow for a start and finish in the Olympic Stadium on the out-and-back course.
There was again no dominant male marathoner entering the 1996 Olympics and the race was considered wide-open. The concern over the heat, and the lack of any favorites, led the pack to run almost together for the bulk of the race and resulted in the closest finish of any Olympic marathon. The three medalists finished within eight seconds of one another, and contested the final outcome on the Olympic track. The race was won by the unheralded Josia Thugwane of South Africa, who held off Korea Lee Bong-Ju, who finished second, only three seconds back, and Kenya Erick Wainaina, who won the bronze medal. Thugwane was an experienced marathoner, as the Atlanta race was the 19th of his career. He had won several races in South Africa, but his only marathon victory outside his native country had come in Honolulu in December 1995. He would later win at Fukuoka in 1997. In his native country, because of his new-found riches, he was a marked man. He had been robbed and shot at only a few months before his Olympic victory, and was required to live under bodyguard protection for him and his family.

56369,"Marathon, Men",1908 Summer Olympics,5,Athletics,24 July 1908,"White City Stadium, London",55 from 16 countries,"42,195 metres (26 miles, 385 yards) point-to-point.",na,"The race started by the East Terrace of Windsor Castle. It has been written (including by our group) that this was done because it was under the windows of the nursery to allow the Princes a good view of the start, but this is certainly false, and has been shown to be so by Bob Wilcock, in his article in Journal of Olympic History, âThe 1908 Olympic Marathonâ (March 2008, Vol 16, No 1; 31-47), and David Davis, in his book, Showdown at Shepherd Bush - The 1908 Olympic Marathon and the Three Runners Who Launched a Sporting Craze.
In fact, notices in The Sporting Life as early as November 1907 note that the Organizing Committee was attempting to receive permission to start the race at Windsor Castle, with no requests from the Royal Family to do so. By April 1908 it was noted that the starting point was confirmed as âon or near the East Lawn below the east terrace of the Castleâ, although it was still subject to the King consent. It was suggested that this was done to avoid any public interference with the start of the race.
The race was started concurrently by Lord Desborough and Jack Andrew, secretary of the Polytechnic Harriers, after they had been given a signal by Princess Mary, which was transmitted to their car. The distance to the finish in front of the Royal Box in the White City Stadium was precisely 26 miles, 385 yards (42,195 metres) and this rather arbitrary distance, which had no particular historical or athletic significance, eventually became the internationally accepted distance for the marathon footrace, declared so by the IAAF in 1921, and used at the Olympics again since 1924.
With a field of 55 runners from 16 nations this was by far the most international field yet assembled for a marathon and the British, quite unrealistically, entertained hopes of considerable success but eight of the 12 British starters failed to finish the race.  Another fancied runner who also dropped out was the Canadian, Tom Longboat, who was competing in the face of American protests.  The Americans claimed that Longboat was a professional but the Organizing Committee eventually allowed Longboat to compete.  Other starters included Georg Lind (19th), a London-based Russian from Estonia who became the first Russian to compete in an Olympic track & field event, and the English-born Canadian, George Goulding (22nd), who would win the 10 km. walk at the 1912 Games.  All of the runners were accompanied by two attendants on bicycles, many of them Olympic cycling competitors, who met them at the Crooked Billet Inn at the six-mile mark.
It was a very warm day for long-distance running, the temperature eventually reaching 78Â° F. (26Â° C.).  Scotsman Thomas Jack led for the first five miles, but dropped out shortly thereafter.  Fred Lord and Jack Price, both British, then ran together in the lead through 10 miles.  At that mark Price pulled away, closely followed by the English-born South African, Charles Hefferon, who had always been near the lead.  Tom Longboat was in second as far out as 17 miles, but he withdrew by 20 miles.  After the excessive heat had taken its toll, the race came down to three runners by the 20 mile mark: Hefferon, the American Johnny Hayes, and Italy Dorando Pietri.  Hefferon had control of the race from 15 through 25 miles, leading Pietri by over 3 minutes at 20 miles.
A little more than one mile from the finish Pietri moved into the lead, passing Hefferon.  However, the effort cost him dearly and Pietri entered the White City Stadium in an advanced state of exhaustion.  He stumbled and fell, but doctors and attendants revived him, administering stimulants, and helping him to his feet.  He then fell four more times over the final lap, each time being helped by his handlers.  He eventually staggered across the finish line, while surrounded by officials, doctors, and attendants.  John Hayes crossed the line, unaided, more than 30 seconds later and, after Pietri had been disqualified for receiving assistance, the American was rightly declared the Olympic champion.
The official statement read, âThat, in the opinion of the judges, M. P. Dorando would have been unable to finish the race without the assistance rendered on the track, and so, therefore, the protest of the U.S.A. is upheld, and the second man, Mr. J. Hayes, is the winner, the protest being made by the South African team being withdrawn.â  Pietri quickly recovered from his ordeal and returned to the Stadium the next day to receive a special award from the Queen.
Gynn and Martin described the assistance given Pietri, âThe assistance given to Pietri was primarily by Jack Andrew, the Honorary General Secretary of the Polytechnic Harriers and the key organizer of the race.  He followed instructions of the medical officer for the race, Doctor Bulger.  He [Andrew] reported, in the August, 1908, issue of The Polytechnic Magazine, âAs regards the actual finish, most of the reports of same are absolutely erroneous regards my assisting the winner - the doctor instructions were emphatic, carrying them out caused disqualification; as the animated photographs show, I only caught Dorando as he was falling at the tape.  What I did then I would do again under similar circumstances.ââ
After the Olympic Games both Hayes and Pietri turned professional and Pietri won each of their four subsequent encounters in New York and San Francisco.  To this day, Dorando Pietri is bettered remembered than the Olympic champion, John Hayes.  Born 16 October 1885 in Mandrio, Reggio Emilia, Italy, Dorando Pietri is the most famous loser in Olympic history.  But he had an excellent career as a marathon runner.  He won his first marathon in 1906 in Rome, but failed to finish the 1906 Olympic marathon a month later.  He had won a 40 km. marathon in Carpi, Italy only 17 days before the Olympic marathon.  As a professional marathoner he won 7 of 12 of his professional races.  He retired in 1911, having won 38 of 59 amateur races and 50 of 69 professional races.
Although the 1908 Olympic marathon is best remembered for the disqualification of Pietri, this does less than justice to John Hayes, who was correctly determined to be the champion, and was an excellent marathon runner in his own right.  He had been born in America soon after his parents emigrated from Ireland, and his initial success came when he took third place in the 1907 Boston Marathon.  Later in the season he won the Yonkers Marathon then, by finishing second in the 1908 Boston race, Hayes won a spot on the Olympic team.
After his Olympic victory, Hayes paid a brief visit to his grandparents in Ireland and then returned to New York where Bloomingdale had plastered their department store with photographs of Hayes and announced that their employee, who had been rumored to train on the store track on the roof, had been promoted to manager of sporting goods.  Years later, Hayes laid to rest this oft-repeated bit of Olympic lore.  He never did actually work at Bloomingdale, or train on the roof.  He drew a salary from Bloomingdale but most of his time was spent training at a track outside Manhattan.
Hayes was interviewed on the night of the race, âI took nothing to eat or drink on the journey.  I think to do so is a great mistake.  Before starting I partook of a light lunch, consisting of two ounces of beef, two slices of toast and a sup of tea.  During the race I merely bathed my face with Florida water and gargled my throat with brandy.
I ran my own race throughout, covering in almost mechanical fashion the first five or six miles at a rate of six minutes a mile.  After that I went as hard as I could to the finish.  Ten miles from home I was ten minutes behind the leader, and then I began to go through the field.  I passed Hefferon on nearing the Stadium, but saw nothing of Dorando until I entered the arena. I do not smoke and I drink only in moderation.â
Hefferon also commented, âThe conditions of the race - weather, roads, &c. - suited me exactly, and I should have won the event.  Two miles from home, however, I accepted a draught of champagne and this mistake cost me the race.  The drink gave me a cramp a mile from the finish and then I lost my lead.â
The tragic sight of Dorando Pietri attempting to finish the 1908 marathon race, despite a body that had betrayed him, touched many people.  One of those people was a young, aspiring songwriter who wrote a song about Pietri.  Entitled simply âDorandoâ, it was one of the first of many hits for Irving Berlin.

The course began and ended in Beerschot Stadium, with the runners doing 11/2 laps of the track at the beginning and end of the race.  Fortunately the weather was cool and damp.  South Africa Chris Gitsham and Belgium Auguste Broos were the early leaders, taking the lead by three kilometres.  Gitsham had been training on the course for several weeks.  At 20 km. the lead pack consisted of Gitsham, Broos, Hannes Kolehmainen, and Italy Ettore Blasi, with Estonia JÃ¼ri Lossmann and the Finn, Juho Tuomikoski, close behind.  Kolehmainen, winner of the 5 and 10K at Stockholm in 1912, took the lead at the midpoint of the race, and overall, he and Gitsham ran together for almost 15 kilometres.  Gitsham, however, was having problems with a leg injury and withdrew at around 37 kilometres.  Kolehmainen by then was pulling away for what appeared would be an easy victory, in what was the fastest time ever run for the marathon, even with the extra-long course.  However, Lossmann closed superbly and finished only about 13 seconds behind the Finn.  Lossmann later declared that had any of his Estonian teammates supported him, instead of going on an all day excursion, he would have won the race.  The third-place finisher, Valerio Arri of Italy, was so delighted with his bronze medal, that he performed three cartwheel somersaults as he crossed the finish line.
One of the Australian competitors, Wilfred Kent-Hughes wrote the following of Kolehmainen victory, âThe winner could not rest his tired muscles.  They wrapped him in the flag of his country, placed a laurel wreath on his head, and forced him to make one more round of the track.  Kolehmainen ran round tiredly, in his fantastic âcostumeâ and reminded one of a Greek god who, dressed in a Roman toga, had just flown down from Olympus.  The crowd wildly cheered him, and the fanatic sports lovers passed him from hand to hand. It surprising he ever managed to survive the great âhonour.ââ
Diplomas of merit were awarded to all runners who finished the race within 25% of the winning time, or anyone under 3-10:44.8, which worked out to be the top 30 runners.

But at the major races, Fukuoka and the 1978 European Championships, he had failed to win, his best placing being third at Fukuoka in 1976.

But the finish was brutal, ascending Montjuic, a small mountain in Barcelona where the Olympic Stadium was located. The rise was about 150 metres (480 feet), and came at the end of 42+ kilometers (26+ miles) of running.
The race started at 6:30 PM, but it was a bright, sunny day, with temperatures approaching 27Â° C. (80Â° F.). Because of the heat the pace was slow and the pack stayed together, with 30 runners still leading thru 20 km.

Hwang and Morishita had separated themselves and together to the base of Montjuic. Up the mountain, Hwang slowly pulled ahead and entered the stadium in the lead. He held on to win the gold medal, Morishita in second, 22 seconds back, and Freigang earning a bronze medal. The winning time, 2-13:23, was the slowest since 1968, and on a sea-level course, since Abebe Bikila win in Roma in 1960.
The men marathon finished just before the start of the Closing Ceremony. Because of the late start for the race, any runners finishing after 2-45, or at about 9:15 PM, could not finish in the main stadium, and the final runners to finish the race were re-directed to an alternate finish line on the warm-up track outside the Olympic Stadium.

But he had several strong contenders, among them the American Buddy Edelen, who in 1963 had broken the world record with 2-14:28 in the Polytechnic race in Britain, and had also won the KoÅ¡ice marathon in Czechoslovakia in 2-15:09.6. Britain had two top marathoners in Basil Heatley and Brian Kilby. Japan was led by Toru Terasawa, who had won the 1963 Fukuoka Marathon, and broken the world record early in 1963 at the Beppu Marathon.
But there was only Bikila. The race began at 1 PM, and was contested over a very flat straight out-and-back course. Bikila ran in the lead pack right from the start. By the turnaround point, this time running in shoes, he was leading by 15 seconds, and from there to the finish, he simply extended the lead, winning by over four minutes. Heatley finished second, but had been third entering the stadium. Third went to a native son, not Terasawa, but rather Kokichi Tsuburaya, who was passed by Heatley on the final turn in the stadium. Brian Kilby finished fourth, and Buddy Edelen, hampered by a sciatic nerve injury, placed sixth.
Tsuburaya was crushed that he had been passed on the track by Heatley in front of the Japanese crowd. He vowed to improve and pushed himself in training, but it resulted in multiple injuries. Finally, in early January 1968, he committed suicide by slashing his carotid artery with a razor blade. The note he left said simply, âCannot run anymore.â

After failing to make the 2012 Kenyan Olympic team, he moved to the road and quickly became almost unbeatable at the marathon. From 2013-16 he won six major city marathons, winning all except the 2013 Berlin Marathon, and breaking 2-05 four times. He came to Rio as a clear favorite, but Olympic marathon favorites have not usually fared well.
The heat and humidity on the last day of the Olympics kept the pace slow, as is usual in the Olympic marathon. At 30K Kipchoge picked up the pace and strung out the field, leaving only two runners by his side with 10 km remaining, American Galen Rupp, silver medallist in the London 10K, who had only run his first marathon at the US Olympic Trials, and Ethiopian Feyisa Lilesa. Kipchoge surged again at 35K and Rupp could not maintain the pace, with Lilesa struggling to stay close. With 6 km remaining Kipchoge was alone, the gold medal decided if disaster did not strike. It did not and the Kenyan won the gold by 1:10 over Lilesa, who was 11 seconds ahead of Rupp, who was closing the margin, but ran out of ground.
In early May 2017, Kipchoge ran a trial race, staged by Nike, in an attempt to break the 2-hour barrier for the marathon. The two other participants in the race were Ethiopian Lelisa Desisa and Eritrean Zersenay Tadesse. The event was held on the Monza race track in Italy, with designated pacers entering the event planned stages. The runners ran behind a pace vehicle, designed to keep them on the ideal pace, but it also provided drafting protection, one of the factors keeping the event from being eligible for record consideration. Drinks were handed to the runners, as needed, by helpers on bicycles, another move that made it ineligible for a record. Finally, all three marathoners wore newly designed, special Nike shoes, and there was some question about their legality for record purposes. In the end, only Kipchoge came close to the barrier, running a âfastest on recordâ time of 2-00:25, although it was not considered for a world best time, because of the problems noted above.
By the late 2010s Kipchoge had stamped himself as the dominant marathoner in the world and many considered him the greatest ever, perhaps rivalled only by Abebe Bikila. From 2013-19 Kipchoge ran 13 marathons, winning all but the 2013 Berlin race, in which he finished second. At Berlin in 2018 he set a world record of 2-01:39, and in 2019, at the London Marathon, his winning time of 2-02:37 was the second fastest marathon ever.

The course was roughly the same as in 1896, measuring this time about 41,860 metres. The Greeks hoped to duplicate the finish of 1896, when Spyridon Louis had provided the home crowd with a Greek winner. In preparation, the Greeks held a trial race on 17 March 1906, from which they selected their Olympic marathoners. The race was won by Anastasios Koutoulakis, with Dimitrios Kantzias second. Although he had finished second, Kantzias was noted to be the Greek favorite.
The marathoners were transported to Marathon the day before the race (30 April [17 April]) and spent the night at the residence of Foreign Minister Skouzes. The route was staffed at one mile intervals with five soldiers, who were enlisted to provide medical supervision. Ambulances, military surgeons, nurses, and stretchers were available at five mile intervals. The route was kept clear by police, assisted by a battalion of infantry, two squadrons of cavalry, and one of gendermerie. The head timekeeper was a lieutenant of the cavalry who rode at the head of the pack, and changed his mount four times.
The 1906 Olympic marathon race started at 3:05 PM (1505) on 1 May [18 April], a very warm day (27Â° C. [81Â° F.]). The starter was G. Karamaliklis. The early lead was held by George Blake (AUS) and William  Frank (USA). At about 25 km., Billy Sherring of Canada passed both runners and dominated the remainder of the race, winning by almost seven minutes. As he passed within two miles of the stadium, a cannon was fired at the Rizarian School to notify the spectators in the Panathenaic Stadium.
When Sherring finished, the disappointment of the Greek crowd was almost palpable, but Prince George greeted him at the stadium entrance and, reminiscent of Louis and 1896, ran with him the entire way to the finish. Sherring finished the race carrying his shoes in his hands. Following Sherring was another foreigner, John Svanberg of Sweden, a well-known distance runner in his native country, who passed Frank near the stadium to finish second. Frank held on to get third place. Blake fell back to finish sixth.
One athlete who did not finish was the Italian, Dorando Pietri, who in 1908 would be involved in the most famous finish in Olympic marathon history when, near collapse, he was helped across the line by the British Olympic officials. He would be disqualified.
The Canadians had tried to send two marathoners, Sherring, and Jack Caffrey, who had twice beaten Sherring in the past year in Canadian distance races. But the proposal to raise money by a civic fund in Hamilton was vetoed by the City Council, and a public concert turned up only $75, not nearly enough for the trip for either man. Sherring was given the money and, on a tip from a bartender, William âButchâ Collier, bet it on a racehorse named Cicely, at six-to-one. Cicely won and Sherring had enough money to go to Athens. He went to Athens over two months early and trained continually on the road between Marathon and Athens. During his stay in Greece, he lost over 20 pounds from his voracious training. One newspaper report of his training noted, âWord was received here today that Sherring, the famous Hamilton sprinter, broke all records in a trial run over the Marathon course at Athens, and will go faster on the day of the race.â

Finland Viljo Heino was to make his marathon dÃ©but at London, and as the world-record holder at 10,000 metres and in the one-hour run, he was considered someone to watch. The London organizers chose to not to run over the point-to-point course used for the 1908 Olympics, which had established the standard marathon distance of 42.195 km. (26 miles, 385 yards). Instead, the race started and finished at Wembley Stadium, looping thru the London suburbs.
Raceday was cloudy and humid, with some wind, with the event starting at 3 PM. The immediate lead was taken by the Belgian Ãtienne Gailly in his marathon dÃ©but. He held the lead almost the entire race, but was passed briefly at about 35 km. by the Korean, Choi Yoon-Chil. However, Gailly regained the lead quickly and held it as he entered Wembley Stadium. Unfortunately, he had given all he had to that point. He was wobbling and stumbling along the track, evoking memories of Dorando Pietri in 1908. On the track he was passed first by Argentina Delfo Cabrera, who had run a steady pace moving up throughout, and then by Britain Tom Richards. Cabrera won the gold medal, with Richards second. Gailly was able to finish the race, and held on for a bronze medal. He had never gone beyond 18 miles in training but before the race said âIf I am still standing at the finish I will have won a medalâ. Gailly did both but only barely.
The following morning at 7.30 am Richards was back at his work as a psychiatric nurse at a hospital around 15 miles from the stadium.

(86Â° F.). There was again no definite favorite, and the field of 101 runners set a slow pace, as the runners were concerned about the heat. At the 20 km. mark, Brazil Vanderlei de Lima opened up a small lead. By 30 km. he had pulled ahead by almost 50 seconds, but gradually the pursuers started to reel him in a bit, chopping 20 seconds off that lead over the next five kilometers. Unfortunately, at the 36 km. mark, a fan ran onto the course and ran directly at de Lima, pushing him briefly off the course. De Lima saw his stride broken, and he was unable to continue at the same pace. At 39 km. he was caught by Italy Stefano Baldini, who went into the lead and held on to win gold medal. The United Statesâ Meb Keflezighi, and Eritrean immigrant, also passed de Lima, and he took the silver medal, with de Lima holding on to win a bronze.
It turned out that the fan who had assaulted de Lima was a deranged former Irish priest, who had a history of these acts. He had once walked out onto the track at a Formula One race, fortunately not being harmed and not causing an accident, or injury to any drivers. De Lima protested the result, appealing that he should have been declared the winner, and that he would have won the race if not for the disturbance. That is unlikely, as Baldini and Keflezighi were closing on him at the time of incident, and he finished almost 11/2 minutes behind Baldini, and 42 seconds behind Keflezighi, only holding off the fourth-place finisher, Britain Jon Brown, by 15 seconds. De Lima protest was disallowed. For Brown, it was an unfortunate second consecutive fourth place finish in the Olympic marathon.

The runners started at the Olympic stadium, ran north to the small town of Sollentuna, where they turned just beyond the main village church and returned to the Olympic stadium.  Unfortunately the day of the race dawned very hot for Stockholm, a common occurrence in Olympic marathon racing.  Gynn and Martin have noted âUnconfirmed reports have suggested a temperature of 32Â° C. (89.6Â° F.) in the shade.â
Most of the world top long-distance runners were present.  The Americans entered 12 runners, the maximum, including the Boston Marathon champions of 1911 (Clarence DeMar) and 1912 (Mike Ryan), two Indian runners (Lewis Tewanima, a Hopi; and Andrew Sockalexis, a Penobscot), and Joe Forshaw, who had run the Olympic marathon in 1906 and 1908, winning the bronze medal at London.  The British entered eight runners, including Harry Barrett, who won the 1909 Polytechnic race, and the 3rd-8th place finishers at the 1912 Polytechnic race.
The top two finishers from the 1912 Polytechnic Marathon were not British but both were present at Stockholm.  Canada James Corkery had won the race, followed by South Africa Chris  Gitsham.  South Africa also entered Kenneth McArthur, who was little known outside of his native country.  But between 1909 and 1911 he had won three marathon distance races in South Africa, and had never been defeated at marathon distances.
The race was led through the early stages by Tatu Kolehmainen, Hannes brother.  At the turn-around at Sollentuna, Chris Gitsham was the leader in 1-12:40, followed by Kolehmainen and McArthur, with a group of five (Fred Lord [GBR], Carlo Speroni [ITA], Alexis Ahlgren [SWE], Sigfrid Jacobsson [SWE], and Corkery) within a minute of the leader.
By 25 km. Kolehmainen had caught Gitsham and the two ran together for several miles.  But Kolehmainen dropped out by 35 km. and McArthur caught his teammate at that point (reached in 2-14:20) and they led by over one minute from Jacobsson and America virtual unknown, Gaston Strobino.
At the base of a hill, a few kilometres outside the stadium, Gitsham stopped to drink, and McArthur pulled away to take the lead for good.  He entered the stadium comfortably ahead, and the two South Africans finished one-two.  Strobino finished third.  Almost a phantom among American track & field medalists, he had qualified for the Olympic team when he had finished 2nd in a half-marathon in New York earlier in 1912.  After the Olympics, Strobino retired and never raced again.
The 1912 Olympic marathon also saw the Gamesâ first tragedy.  Portuguese marathoner Francisco LÃ¡zaro from the effects of the race and the hot weather.  Taken to Seraphim Hospital, he was never revived and he died on the morning after the race at 0620, the first fatality during an Olympic event.
Kennedy McArthur may be the least known Olympic marathon gold medalist.  South African historians know little of his life.  But Roger Gynn and Dave Martin, in their book on Olympic marathons, note that he is known to have run six marathons in his running career, and never lost.
In addition to the gold medal, Kennedy McArthur was awarded the Challenge Trophy for the marathon race, that had been donated in 1908 by the King of Greece.  The runners who finished in places 4-28 in the marathon were also awarded diplomas of merit.  This was all runners finishing within 20% of the winning time.

The course began and ended in the Colombes Stadium and run over an out-and-back course into the French country to the northwest of Paris. The defending champion, Hannes Kolehmainen, competed in 1924, although he had not run any of the Finnish trial races. The Finnish Olympic trial was won by Willie KyrÃ¶nen with Albin Stenroos second. Also highly considered was the British runner, Duncan Wright. The top American runner was probably Clarence DeMar who had run in the 1912 Olympic marathon, and would eventually win seven Boston marathons.
The race started at 5:23 PM, delayed for two hours because the officials were concerned about the heat that had so affected the cross-country race the previous day. The early lead was taken by Greece Alexandros Kranis, but France Georges Verger took over the lead at about 20 km. But just before the turnaround, Stenroos took the lead from Verger and powered ahead to an easy victory, winning by almost six minutes. By 27 km. a small pack of DeMar, Finland Lauri Halonen, and Italy Romeo Bertini had settled into the race for the other medals. Bertini won the silver medal, a minute of DeMar who took the bronze.

By 1973, the West Germans had established the first all-female marathons, and the pioneer administrator who supported women in the marathon was the German Dr. Ernst van Aaken. In 1983 a women marathon was included at the first Athletics World Championships in Helsinki, won by Grete Waitz of Norway. Waitz, a former track runner, was the first great female marathoner, winning the New York Marathon from 1979-83, and she would eventually win New York nine times. She was the early favorite for Los Angeles.  Also to be watched were Portugal Rosa Mota, who had won the 1982 European Championship, and America Joan Benoit, who won the 1979 and 1983 Boston Marathon. Her 1983 Boston win was in a world marathon best time of 2-22:43. But Benoit was not fully healthy, having required arthroscopic surgery on her knee only a few weeks before the US Olympic Trial, and she was considered fortunate to make the team.
The women marathon was the first track & field event of the 1984 Olympics, starting at 8 AM. It started at the Santa Monica City College track and ran along LA freeways to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Benoit moved into the lead at 7 km., and Waitz let her get away, saying later that she thought the move was made too early. But Benoit never came back. She stayed in the lead throughout, running by herself for most of the race, winning by almost 11/2 minutes, with Waitz winning the silver medal and Mota the bronze.
Finishing in 37th place was Swiss runner Gaby Andersen-Schiess, but that simple statement belies the drama of her finish. Andersen-Schiess was not a medal favorite but was still considered a top runner. However, the heat affected her and when she entered the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum at the finish of the race, she essentially wobbled onto the track, her form redolent of Dorando Pietri in 1908 or Jim Peters at the finish of the 1954 British Empire Games marathon. Andersen-Schiess course was all over the track on her final lap of the stadium, as she could not maintain a straight line, and she appeared near collapse throughout. There were calls to remove her from the race and stop her, for fears of her health, but no one intervened and she finished the race. Though exhausted, she was well within a few hours and suffered no ill effects from her effort.

African men had been world-class distance runners since the early 1960s, but women were only becoming liberated enough to compete internationally. At the Tianjin marathon in April 1993, Chinese women finished in the eight places, all under 2-26, and four of them moved in to the world top 10 list. This followed several other stunning times by Chinese female distance runners, but many of these were later discredited when systematic doping regimens were revealed in the Chinese athletics hierarchy.
Portugal had a new women marathon star in Manuela Machado, who won the 1994 European Championships and the 1995 World Championships. Germany Uta Pippig had won the Boston Marathon in 1994-96 and was highly considered. The top African woman was likely Kenya Tegla Leroupe, who won the 1994 New York Marathon.
To avoid the summer heat of Atlanta, the race started at 7:05 AM, the morning after the bombing at the Centennial Olympic Park. Pippig took the early lead and led by 13 seconds at five kilometers, and she increased this to 28 second at 10 km. At 20 km. she was caught by Ethiopia Fatuma Roba and Pippig was also overtaken by defending champion Valentina Yegorova, Machado, Japan silver medalist from 1992, Yuko Arimori, and Romania Lidia Åimon. Pippig would eventually drop out. Roba powered ahead and held a 28-second lead at 25 km. She ran unchallenged to a 2-minute victory in a time of 2-26:05, considered very fast on the hilly course, in the Southern summer weather. Yegorova won the silver medal, and Arimori the bronze medal.

During the Seoul race, Mota ran in the lead group throughout and never really trailed. Running with her for most of the race were two well-considered runners, Australia Lisa Martin and the GDR Katrin DÃ¶rre.

In 2003 she stunned the athletics world by winning London in 2-15:25, a mark that would place her highly in most major men marathons.
The race began at Marathon, and ran point-to-point to the Olympic Stadium in Athina, although it was not exactly the same course as that used for the 1896 Olympic marathon. It started at 6 PM, but the day was brutally hot, with temperatures reaching 35Â° C. (95Â° F.) Given that weather nobody expected fast times. By 20 km. a pack of five runners held the lead, which included Radcliffe, Catherine Ndereba of Kenya, Mizuki Noguchi and Reiko Tosa of Japan, and Elfenesh Alemu of Ethiopia.

If it was supposed to be cooler, Sapporo had not heard that rumor as the morning of the women marathon had a wet-bulb temperature of 31Â° C. (88Â° F.) and a dew point of 20Â° C. (72Â° F.).
With the COVID pandemic none of the women marathon majors had been held yet in 2021 so picking favorites was difficult. Kenyan runners were expected to be dominant, however, led by Peres Jepchirchir, Brigid Kosgei, and Ruth Chepngetich.
With the heat the early pace was slow, as expected. The halfway point was reached only in 1-15:14, with 12 runners together in the lead. Chepngetich fell off the pace just before 30 km and would not finish. There were seven runners still together with 10 km remaining.
At 35 km, there were five leaders â Kosgei, Jepchirchir, Israeli Lonah Chemtai, Bahraini Eunice Chumba, and the surprising American Molly Seidel. Chumba gave way at 36 km, and at 38 km Seidel dropped back a few metres. Jepchirchir then hammered the pace, dropping Kosgei, and Chemtai-Saltpeter was not only dropped, but she would end up walking in and finishing 66th.
Jepchirchir maintained her pace until the final kilometre when she went into survival mode, winning gold in 2-27:20. Behind her Kosgei made it a 1-2 for Kenya, as Seidel won bronze by almost a minute over Ethiopian Roza Dereje.

Barcelona was Yegorova 14th career marathon, but only her second win, although she had finished second to Rosa Mota at the 1990 European Championships. She would later win the prestigious Tokyo race in 1993 and 1994. Arimori was running her fourth career marathon, but had never won. After the 1992 Olympics, she took a hiatus from competition, returning in 1995 to win the Sapporo marathon.

After 2 hours of running Kirwa pushed the pace and strung out the lead group, deciding the medals as she, Sumgong, and Dibaba pulled ahead. Dibaba was on Kirwa shoulder while Sumgong was seemingly dropped, quickly losing 5-8 metres. By 24 miles, however, the leading threesome was back together and then Sumgong made her challenge, dropping Dibaba at the 25-mile mark. With one kilometer remaining Sumgong surged again, finally putting space between herself and Kirwa. Sumgong held on, winning the gold medal by 9 seconds over Kirwa, the first ever gold for Kenya in this race, despite the history of Kenyan distance running dominance. Dibaba took bronze over her countrywoman Tsegaye.

By 35K she had opened a 70-second lead. Britain Paula Radcliffe, the world-record holder, had gamely hung on early, but injuries had her well below her best and she barely finished, placing 23rd.

The pre-race favorite was Kenyan Mary Keitany, who had won the London Marathon in April, but her teammates, Edna Kiplagat and Priscah Jeptoo were expected to challenge, having placed 1-2 at the 2011 World Championships. The Kenyan team was so strong that they had swept the medals at Daegu, and third-place finisher Sharon Cherop was not even selected for the Olympic team.
The race started slowly in the rain, and at the halfway point 28 runners remained together. At 25 km Kiplagat made the first serious attack, dropping all but her teammates and the three Ethiopians, led by Tiki Gelana, who had won the Rotterdam Marathon in April in 2-18:58 and won at Amsterdam in October 2011. Russian Tatyana Arkhipova bridged to the leaders at 32 km, and by 35 km, only four were left in the main pack to contest the medals â Keitany, Jeptoo, Gelana, and Arkhipova. Keitany attempted a surge on The Embankment, similar to the one that had won her the London Marathon, but nobody budged. The four went through 40 km together and Gelana then attacked, with only Jeptoo able to respond. Gelana quickly opened about 20 metres on Jeptoo but that margin stayed intact through the finish line, as Jeptoo could not close, and Gelana could not open further, winning the gold medal by five seconds. Behind them Keitany was spent and would drop to fourth, as Arkhipova won bronze.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected.
With re-testing, six athletes would later be disqualified in this event, although the medalists were not implicated. The highest finisher to be DQed was Ukrainian Tetiana Hamera-Shmyrko, who originally finished fifth. Also disqualified were China Wang Jiali (58th), two athletes from Turkey â Bahar DoÄan (62nd) and ÃmmÃ¼ Kiraz (88th), and two athletes who did not finish â Colombian Yolanda Caballero and Russian Liliya Shobukhova.

The reigning world champion was Joey Mantia, bringing his skills from the sport of inline skating. His predecessor was Lee Seung-Hun, leader in the World Cup standings and 2010 Olympic champion in the 10,000 m as well as the home favorite. The list of medal contenders was long, though, and included among others Andrea Giovannini, Livio Wenger, Bart Swings, Peter Michael, Alexis Contin and Koen Verweij.
Most of the contenders survived the tactical semi-finals, although the elimination of 5,000 m bronze medallist Sverre Lunde Pedersen was a surprise. In the final, Wenger and Viktor Hald Thorup staged an attack after 6 laps, gaining some 75 m on the pack. Skating in service of Lee, Chung Jae-Won caught the attackers. With three laps to go, 4-time Olympic champion Sven Kramer launched an attack, with the intent of either personal gain or launching his team mate Verweij. Kramer was caught by small group, led by Swings but including Lee and Verweij. The Korean was by far the strongest in the resulting sprint, to the delight of the home crowd. Swings placed second to win Belgium first Winter Olympic medal in 20 years, while Verweij held on for the bronze.

Defending champion Lee Seung-Hoon had been a world champion in short track, as had the #2 in the World Cup ranking, Ruslan Zakharov. Three-time world champion Joey Mantia was a 28-time world champion in inline speed skating, while the Belgian leader in the World Cup was Bart Swings, who held 15 titles in that sport. Outsider Jorrit Bergsma, the 2020 world champion, was also a former Dutch champion in marathon skating.
The main surprise of the semi-finals was the elimination of Zakharov. The 2014 Olympic short track champion suffered a fall and was unable to qualify. The final was dominated by Swings. He personally quashed all run-away attempts. With two laps to go, Bergsma sped up for a long sprint, but most of the pack was able to follow. At the bell, Swings took the lead, only to be quickly overtaken by Lee. The Korean still headed the field as Swings passed him on the outside. Meanwhile, both Mantia and Lee compatriot Jeong Jae-Won tried to overtake from the inside.
Swings crossed the line for the first Belgian gold medal at the Olympic Winter Games since 1948, when Micheline Lannoy and Pierre Baugniet won the figure skating pairs event. Only 0.07 seconds behind him, Jeong emerged second based on the photo finish. The difference between third and fourth was even smaller, with just 0.002 separating Lee bronze from Mantia fourth place.

But there were many others vying for the inaugural title: successful inline skater Francesca Lollobrigida, five-time Olympic champion Claudia Pechstein, and the strong Japanese team with Ayana Sato and Nana Takagi.
The semi-finals already cut some of the favorites out of the equation, as Blondin fell in the second heat and took out Sato. In the final, Estonia Saskia Alusalu tried to escape the peloton, gaining half a lap. But when the group geared up, her advantage quickly faded, being caught with around two laps to go. At the bell, Schouten tried to make it into a long sprint, which caused a fracture in the pack. In the final curve, the crowd cheered on Kim as she and Takagi chased Schouten. Both of them passed the Dutchwoman, and Takagi held on until the finish line, ahead of Kim and Schouten. Takagi is the sister of Miho who won medals in the 1,000 and 1,500 m in PyeongChang and also skated on the golden Japanese pursuit team.

This included two-time world champion Ivanie Blondin, inline skating great Francesca Lollobrigida, Korea Kim Bo-Reum, as well as Schouten teammate Marijke Groenewoud, who had surprisingly claimed the 2021 world title when Schouten was held up in the final sprint.
The semi-finals were rather nervous. In the first, Groenwoud fell, but she was able to return to the group and qualify for the final. That could not be said for defending champion Nana Takagi. After her dramatic fall earlier in the team pursuit, she again fell in the second semi-final.
In the final, the race was fairly compact, but saw Groenewoud fall again and lose contact. With two laps left, an intact pack (save for Groenewoud) started the final sprint. ValÃ©rie Maltais increased the speed, hoping to launch her teammate Blondin to victory. At the bell, Schouten had taken the lead, followed by Blondin and Lollobrigida. The Italian briefly lost her balance, leaving Blondin in front going into the final curve. With 50 m to go, Schouten passed the Canadian, crossing the line first, while Lollobrigida was just too late to join the fight for gold and came in third.
By winning her third gold and fourth medal in Beijing, Schouten became the most successful Dutch Winter Olympian ever at a single Games, beating three-time champions Ard Schenk and Yvonne van Gennip.

Ties broken by lightest bodyweight.,na,"Greece Akakios Kakiasvili had won this class in 1992, then competing for the Unified Team as a Georgian, and under the name Kâakhi Kâakhiashvili. At Atlanta in 1996, Kakiasvili, then competing for Greece, won gold in the heavyweight I class. He was 1998-99 World Champion as a middle-heavy and came to Sydney as the favorite to win his third consecutive gold medal. Kakiasvili succeeded but it was a close contest against Poland Szymon KoÅecki. Kakiasvili led with a world record snatch of 185.0 kg, but KoÅecki and Russian Aleksey Petrov had the best clean & jerk with 222.5 kg, meaning that Kakiasvili and KoÅecki tied at 405.0 kg, with Petrov getting the bronze medal. However, Kakiasvili won the gold medal on bodyweight, 92.06 to 93.58 kg.
This was Kakiasvili third consecutive gold medal, equalling the record set by Turkey Naim SÃ¼leymanoÄlu in 1988-96 and by his Greek teammate Pyrros Dimas, who had done it the day before in Sydney. Turkey Halil Mutlu would also equal this mark at Athinai in 2004. Kakiasvili attempted to win a fourth gold in 2004 but went out after failing on his three clean & jerks.

Ties broken by lightest bodyweight.,na,"As the defending Olympic Champion, the reigning World Champion (with additional titles in 2006 and the light-heavyweight division in 2005), and the most recent Asian Games Champion, Ilya Ilyin was heavily favored to take gold again in the men middle-heavyweight division of the 2012 Olympic weightlifting tournament. Among his strongest challengers were Aleksandr Ivanov of Russia, the 2010 World Champion, his compatriot Andrey Demanov, the 2011 European Champion, 2008 runner-up, and 2006 and 2009 bronze medalist, Anatolii CÃ®rÃ®cu of Moldova, the reigning European Champion and runner-up in 2011, and Kim Min-Jae of South Korea, twice Asian Champion (2011 and 2012) and bronze medalist at the 2009 World and 2010 Asian Championships.
The competition in the snatch portion was tight, with Ilyin, Ivanov, and Kim all lifting 185 kg. Kim fell down to seventh after failing to lift 220 kg, and then 221 kg, before Ilyin even made a first attempt. Ilyin came in at 224 kg and lifted it with ease, breaking his own Olympic record for total points with a score of 409. Though six tried, only half were able to match this, starting with Ivanov who lifted the same weight and thus tied Ilyin in points and, having the lower body weight, put himself in the gold medal position. Demanov then managed 225 kg in two attempts, lining himself up for bronze, but he was quickly displaced by CÃ®rÃ®cu, who lifted 226 kg to tie the score and, as the lighter competitor, knock Demanov off the podium. For his second attempt, Ilyin lifted 228 kg, again breaking his own Olympic record (this time in the clean and jerk) and setting a world record for total points with 413. Neither CÃ®rÃ®cu nor Ivanov could respond and thus, assured of gold, Ilyin went for a world record clean and jerk lift, succeeding in his attempt and setting the new bar at 233 kg.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected.
And in November 2016 this event results underwent drastic changes, as it proved to be possibly the âdirtiestâ event in Olympic history, maybe rivaled only by the 2012 women athletics 1,500 metres. Between 21 November 2016 and 12 January 2017 seven of the top 11 finishers in this event were implicated in PED usage and disqualified. This included all three medalists â Ilya Ilyin, Aleksandr Ivanov, and Anatolii CÃ®rÃ®cu, but also the 4th Andrey Demanov, 6th (Ä°ntiqam Zairov), 7th (Almas Uteshov), and 11th (Norayr Vardanyan) place finishers. The athlete listed 7th, as of October 2019, is Abbas Al-Qaisoum (KSA), who originally finished only 15th.
Iranian Saeid Mohammadpour was moved up to the gold medal and Korean Kim Min-Jae was awarded the silver medal. Such was the carnage in the results of this event, however, that the original ninth-place finisher, Poland Tomasz Zielinski, who seemed eligible for the bronze medal, was not originally advanced to a medal, likely because he had a positive pre-Games test for nandrolone just before the 2016 Rio Olympics. His brother, Adrian Zielinski, also tested positive before the 2016 Games and was sent home. Ilyin set a record of sorts, by defending his gold medal disqualification from the 2008 Olympics in the same weight class, which was also announced in November 2016. He became the first Olympian to ever âdefendâ a gold medal disqualification.

In the B Group, held in the afternoon, Konstantinov teammate, Khadzhimurat Akkayev, lifted 185.0 kg in the snatch, which nobody would match in the A Group. He then cleaned & jerked 217.0 kg and predicted that his total of 402.0 kg would win the gold medal. However, Poland Szymon KoÅecki, world record holder in the clean & jerk, lifted 224.0 kg in that lift and totalled 403.0 kg. He was then beaten by Ilyin who put up 226 kg in the clean & jerk to win the gold medal with a total of 406.0 kg. PaÅayev had the best snatch in Group A with 181.0 kg but struggled in clean & jerk and placed only fifth, while Konstantinov was never a factor, finishing eighth.
Akkayev total held on for a rare B Group bronze medal, but he was not happy. He started in the B Group because of his low starting weight which he attributed to his coach, noting, âMy coach is a jerk. If I had competed in Group A I would have won the gold.â Ilyin would return in 2012 and defend his gold medal in London.

This was one of the many events affected.
In November 2016, the standings completely changed when Ilya Ilyin (KAZ / gold), Khadzhimurat Akkayev (RUS / bronze), and Nizami PaÅayev (AZE / 5th) all tested positive for anabolic steroids, and were all disqualified. The medals were re-assigned as follows: Gold â Szymon KoÅecki (POL); Silver â Arsen Kasabijew (GEO); and Bronze â Yoandry HernÃ¡ndez (CUB).
In 2012 Ilya Ilyin again seemed to win the gold medal in this class, but in November 2016, his sample from the London Games also re-tested positive, that time for turinabol (dehydrochloromethyltestosterone) and stanozolol. He was again disqualified, making him the only Olympian ever to lose two gold medals at different Games for PED usage.

Ties broken by lightest bodyweight.,na,"Unlike the World Championships, there was no weight class up to 89 kg contested at the Olympics. As a result, this created the biggest gap between two weight divisions with a 15 kg difference from light-heavyweight (81 kg) and middle-heavyweight (96 kg). The two world record holders in this class Sohrab Moradi, season best 384 kg, and Tian Tao, qualification best 410 kg, were absent in Tokyo. Moradi, the holder of the snatch (186 kg) and total (416 kg) record, did not qualify whereas Tian, record holder in clean & jerk (231 kg), missed the Games due to an elbow injury. Tian was the reigning world champion and also the back-to-back winner of the last two Asian championships. Their absence made the best qualifiers for this event Fares Ibrahim with 404 kg, and Yauhen Tsikhantsou with 400 kg, but both set these results back in 2019. In that year Ibrahim won silver at the World Championships, and Tsikhantsou was the European champion and also world champion in the 102 kg class. Both men had not competed in the 96 kg class since late 2019, and Tsikhantsou had not participated in any event since then. Ibrahim finished second in the 102 kg class at the 2020 Asian championships, held in April 2021. As Jhonatan Rivas (COL), season best 393 kg, missed the Games following the Colombian Weightlifting Federation being sanctioned due to the high number of doping offences, the competitors in Tokyo with the season bests were the reigning European champion Anton Pliesnoi with 393 kg, Boady Santavy 389 kg, and Keydomar Vallenilla 384 kg.
After the snatch the first five lifters were packed together within 2 kg of each other. Santavy led the field with 178 kg followed by Vallenilla, Ibrahim, and Pliesnoi with 177 kg each, and then Chen Po-Jen with 176 kg. Chen was the only one to attempt 180 kg, but failed. Of the top five, Santavy ended his clean & jerk attempts first, with a final lift of 208 kg, which moved him into first place, but when Vallenilla and Pliesnoi both cleared 210 kg for a total of 387 kg they both overtook Santavy by 1 kg. Chen failed to lift 211 kg in his last attempt and was out of the medals, while Vallenilla, already in first place, tried to improve his total with 215 and 216 kg, respectively, but missed both. Ibrahim then started his clean & jerk attempts and he secured gold with his first try following a 217 kg lift, which he improved to 225 kg in the second lift. His 232 kg in the third attempt would have been a world record, but he did not make it.
Ibrahim gold medal was still historical, as it was the first ever Olympic gold medal for Qatar. With Bekdoolot Rasulbekov finishing sixth he achieved Kyrgyzstan best ever Olympic weightlifting result. Finishing tenth in this event was Cyrille Tchatchet II who represented the Refugee Olympic Team after being invited by the IOC. Also present was Palestine first ever Olympic weightlifter Mohammed Hamada, who had received a Tripartite Commission Invitation.

The final came down to Douglas and Baker, and was described as the best match of the tournament. The first round was even. Douglas knocked Baker down in round two, but he continued in a closely fought battle. However, Douglas hung on in round three to win on points. Douglas was presented his gold medal by his father, who was then the President of the ABA. John Douglas, the son, was actually better known as a cricketer and later captained Essex County and England teams. He and his father died tragically in a sea disaster returning from Finland in December 1930.
Snowy Baker is the greatest all-around athlete ever produced by Australia. He competed at the 1908 Olympics in boxing, diving, and swimming. In addition to those three sports, he represented Australia at the international level in rugby union and water polo. He was also state or national caliber in cricket, track & field athletics, and rowing. In December 1908, he was appointed referee for the Jack Johnson vs. Tommy Burns heavyweight professional bout, which was held in Sydney, but Johnson objected to Baker snow-white hair (hence his nickname), and he was replaced.

Deng tied the Olympic record 115 kg, only 2 kg off the world record, in the snatch portion, while Karina Goricheva of Kazakhstan was behind her at 111 kg.

Each was also a world record holder, Maeza in the clean and jerk and Tsarukayeva in the snatch.

Tsarukayeva and Maneza dominated the snatch portion of the event, with lifts of 112 kg and 110 kg respectively; next in line was ÅimÅek, who only managed 105 kg. The Russian fell behind in the clean and jerk, however, lifting 125 kg in her first attempt and then failing to lift 130 kg in two subsequent ones.

Not to be outdone, the Canadian lifted 133 kg in her next attempt to move into second place, a feat that ÅimÅek was unable to replicate. Milka Maneva of Bulgaria, bronze medalist at the 2008 European Championships, then attempted to knock ÅimÅek off the podium entirely by lifting 134 kg, which would have tied her with Girard for points and placed her in second by virtue of her lower body weight, but she failed and remained in fourth. Maneza was more successful, lifting 135 kg on her first attempt to surpass Tsarukayeva by eight points, tie the Olympic record for the clean and jerk, set a new one for total score, and win the gold medal. Already guaranteed bronze, Girard then attempted to lift the same weight to pass the Russian as well, but failed. Guaranteed to be an Olympic Champion, with her final two attempts Maneza tried to lift 144 kg, which would have broken the world record for the clean and jerk, but was unsuccessful.

There was no Chinese competitor taking part, as the 2016 Olympic gold medallist Deng Wei was not selected due to injury. This unspecified injury had prevented her from competing at the 2020 Asian Championships, held only a few months before the Olympics. She had dominated this weight class and had won the last two World Championships in 2018-19, the 2019 World Cup held in Fuzhou, and the Asian Championships in 2019, each time setting world records in snatch, clean & jerk, and total. Her latest world records were 117 kg in snatch, 145 kg in clean & jerk, and 261 kg in total. Due to Romania being suspended as a result of multiple doping offenses, Loredana Toma was also not competing in Tokyo. She had a season best 244 kg, and was the European champion in 2017 and 2018 in the 63 kg class and 2019 and 2020 (held in 2021) in the 64 kg class. She was also the 2017 world champion (63 kg) when China was banned. At the last two World championships, Toma finished third with Rim Un-Sim winning silver on both occasions, but as PRK decided not to send a team to the Olympics due to the COVID-19 pandemic, none of the medallists from the last two World Championships competed in Tokyo. Consequently, Mercedes PÃ©rez, qualification best 238 kg, who finished fourth at the last two World Championships, was one of the favourites, but she was beaten by Maude Charron, season best 240 kg, at the Pan American Championships just a few months before the Tokyo Games. Other fancied competitors were Sarah Davies, season best 230 kg and silver medallist at the last European Championships, Angie Paola Palacios, season best 229 kg, and Chen Wen-Huei, season best 228 kg and reigning Asian champion.
After the snatch element, Charron was in the lead with 105 kg followed by Palacios and Giorgia Bordignon with 104 kg each, with Chen lifting 103 kg, and PÃ©rez 101 kg. Charron and Palacios both missed 108 kg in their last attempts and PÃ©rez failed 105 kg with her final lift. The clean & jerk started with nine athletes separated by only 5 kg. When Palacios missed 127 kg in her last lift, five athletes were still fighting for the medals, but only Bordignon with 128 kg and Charron with 133 kg were able to set valid lifts. This gave Charron gold and Bordignon silver with Chen taking bronze. Bordignon enjoyed a perfect competition, setting personal bests in both variants of the lifts, and was the only athlete in this event who did not miss any of her six lifts, as she won the first ever Olympic weightlifting medal by an Italian female. Also competing in this event was Yasmin Zammit Stevens, the first ever Maltese female weightlifter.
The Olympic Standard for Olympic records was 108 kg for snatch, 134 kg for clean & jerk, and 242 kg for total, none of which were broken in Tokyo.

The competition started early afternoon with group B with Abdullah, who only entered with 320 kg, lifting a total of 342 kg, which was the third best mark of the season and only four lifters achieved a better mark during the qualification for Tokyo. In group A, five lifters scored better than Abdullah in snatch, but three of them were not able to beat his total mark as his 190 kg in clean & jerk remained the second-best lift. Only Mayora and Briken Calja also lifted 190 kg, which gave Mayora silver, but Calja could only finish in fourth place.

Untouchable was Shi, who had already a clear margin of 10 kg after the snatch and also produced the best performance with 198 kg in clean & jerk to set the first new world record at this Games with 364 kg in total.
The Olympic Standard for Olympic records was 158 kg for snatch, 190 kg for clean & jerk, and 345 kg for total.

In 1930 that title went to Kurt Helbig, who was the current world record holder and had won gold at Amsterdam in the lightweight class, but he did not compete at Los Angeles. Another medal contender was Austrian Karl Hipfinger, the 1929 European Champion.
Ismayr and Galimberti tied in the press with 102.5 kg, also equaled by Roger FranÃ§ois (FRA). Ismayr moved 5.0 kg ahead after the snatch, with Galimberti second, and FranÃ§ois in third. The best lift in the clean & jerk was by Hipfinger, which brought him the bronze medal. Ismayr remained in first to garner gold with Galimberti taking another silver medal. In 1936 at Berlin, Ismayr would win the silver medal.

Kurynov then lifted a world record 170.0 kg, which broke Kono total world record with 437.5 kg, and brought him the gold medal.
Kono continued to compete through 1964 but retired when he failed to make the USA team for Tokyo. Kurynov became the top lifter in this class in the early 1960s, winning the World title from 1961-63 and the European title from 1960-63.

However, the nod had to go to the reigning Olympic, and three-time World champion, Lu Xiaojun of China, despite failing to register a total at the 2015 World Championships, when he won the snatch. Egypt Mohamed Ihab, the silver medalist at the last two World Championships, and known for big lifts near the end of a competition, was also fighting for a medal, as was the Kazakhstan Nidzhat Rakhimov, the former Azerbaijani, who had just returned from a two-year doping ban.
With three lifters tied in first place in the snatch at 165 kg, Andranik Karapetyan of Armenia and Lu broke that up with 170 kg + lifts. Lu then broke his own three-year-old snatch world record of 176 kg by lifting 1 kg more. That took him into the clean & jerk with a lead of 3 kg. It appeared the 77 kg gold medal was Lu to lose after Karapetyan suffered a ghastly arm injury on his second attempt at the clean & jerk. Rakhimov, who was 12 kg behind when Lu finished his lifts, surprisingly stole the gold medal, but it took a world record lift of 214 kg, and tied Lu on 379 kg, but the Kazakhstan lifter took the gold medal by virtue of his lighter body weight.
Upon winning bronze, Ihab, one of six weightlifting brothers, was the first Egyptian to win an Olympic medal in this middleweight class since 1936, when countryman Khadr El-Touni won gold at the Berlin Games.
Side note: Kazakhstan, who lost five Olympic titles from 2008 and 2012 through retrospective doping positives, was only allowed to compete because their outstanding doping cases were not fully processed in time for the 2016 Games. And that was how the results seem to end. However, in March 2022, after re-test if samples from Rio, it was announced that the gold medalist Nidzhat Rakhimov (of Kazakhstan) had tampered with his urine specimens and swapped his specimen for another clean one. He was disqualified and lost his gold medal. As of 22 March 2022 no medal advancements have been announced yet.

Filimonov lifted 200.0 kg but then failed on his final attempt with 205.0 kg, giving the gold medal to SaÄÄ±r.
The bronze went to Russian Oleg Perepechenov and remained that way for nine years. However, in 2013, re-testing of the doping samples from Athinai revealed that Perepechenov had taken what was described only as a âfunny substanceâ and he was retroactively disqualified, despite it being outside the 8-year statute of limitations set by WADA.

This left Zhan Xugang of China a clear road to his second gold medal, having won the 1996 lightweight class, but he trailed Greece Viktor Mitrou, a former Albanian, after the snatch, and had to equal the clean & jerk world record of 207.5 kg to enable them to tie with 367.5 kg total.

The first was Lu Xiaojun, 2009 and 2011 World Champion, 2010 runner-up, 2011 Asian Champion, and 2008 runner-up. The other, Lu Haojie, was six years younger than his compatriot and a potential successor, having won the most recent Chinese National Championships. They would face a challenge, however, from defending Olympic Champion Sa Jae-Hyeok of South Korea, although his best finish in a major international event since had been third at the 2011 World Championships and the 2012 Asian Championships (the latter in the light-heavyweight category).
The field was whittled down before the event started, when Hysen Pulaku of Albania became the first participant of the Games to test positive for a banned substance and be removed from the festivities. Then Gevorg Davtyan of Armenia, 2008 Olympic bronze medalist, twice European Champion (2008, 2010) and once runner-up (2007), and 2010 World Champion and 2009 runner-up, failed the weigh-in and was withdrawn from the competition. Nearing the end of the snatch portion Sa, already in first place, tried to increase his lead with a lift of 162 kg, but dislocated his shoulder in the attempt and was unable to complete the event. Even a score of 158 kg would have been sufficient to remain in third place, but it would have been nowhere near the massive lifts of Lu Haojie and Lu Xiaojun, who had scored 170 and 175 kg respectively, and the latter of whom broke his own world record by 1 kilogram. There was confusion in the snatch with Lu Haojie waving his third attempt and Lu Xiaojun not realizing that his teammate had done so, thereby failing to appear for his third lift (which would have been an attempt at 177 kg).
Chatuphum Chinnawong of Thailand third-place lift of 157 kg meant that the Chinese competitors were essentially untouchable on the podium. Lu Haojie lifted 190 kg in his first attempt to take an early lead, and was followed in this feat by IvÃ¡n Cambar of Cuba, winner of the event at the last two Pan American Games. Chinnawong moved into second place by lifting 191 kg while Lu Haojie, aiming to try that weight in his next attempt, was unable to continue after suffering a wrist injury on his previous lift. Lu Haojie would remain in contention, however, having posted one successful score in the clean and jerk. Cambar next lift was a successful 194 kg, returning to second place, although still eleven points behind Lu Haojie. Lu Xiaojun then arrived with an opening 195 kg lift, giving him a total of 370 points, which guaranteed him the gold medal, as he was ten points ahead of his injured compatriot and twenty-one ahead of Cambar. Chinnawong attempted to lift the same weight and enter the bronze medal position, but failed in both attempts and remained in fourth. Ibrahim Ramadan of Egypt followed with an attempt at 197 kg, which would have put him three points ahead of Cambar and onto the podium, but was unsuccessful and forced to make due with fifth place. Cambar did not even bother to take his final attempt, settling for bronze, while Lu Xiaojun used has last two turns to lift 204 kg and best his own world record for total points by one.

To the displeasure of the crowd, Baker carefully held on to this minimal lead although he conceded two penalties for defensive posture. The desperate Lipâartâeliani, however, also failed to score, and thus the Georgian had to settle for silver.

World #2 was Georgian Varlam Lipâartâeliani, but he lost in the round of 16 to Australian Mark Anthony. And then the third seed, Japan Masashi Nishiyama lost in the quarter-finals to Korean Song Dae-Nam.
Song moved on to the final by defeating two-time Olympic medalist Brazilian Tiago Camilo in the semis, where he met Cuban Asley GonzÃ¡lez, who had a relatively open road to the final, thanks to many of the upsets. The final was a stalling match as both were given shido for non-combativity and at regulation time the match was scoreless. But 11 seconds into golden time, Song threw GonzÃ¡lez to win the gold medal.
The bronze medals went to Iliadis, who came back to defeat Camilo for the bronze, and Nishiyama, who defeated Russian Kirill Denisov, who had lost to GonzÃ¡lez in the semi-finals.

Honorato advanced to the final, where he met Mark Huizinga of the Netherlands. Huizinga was a three-time European Champion (1996-98) and bronze medalist in this class in 1996. In the final, Huizinga used a leg throw to win by ippon in 3:22. Huizinga would continue to win international medals â including a bronze in this class at the 2004 Olympics.

Competitors losing to the finalists entered repechage tournament for bronze medals.,na,"When Mongolia Soronzonboldyn Battsetseg won a bronze medal at the 2012 Olympic Games in London in the 63 kg weight class, it was her country first Olympic wrestling medal since 1980. She became a household name, adorning billboards and such, and was more popular than the president of Mongolia. Already the 2010 World champion at the time of the London Olympics, she added another World title in 2015 (after a World silver in 2013) making her the favourite for the 63kg class coming into Rio 2016. With Kaori Icho of Japan, who she had major global losses to, moving down to the 58 kg, Battsetseg had former Icho understudy, the 2015 World silver medalist Risako Kawai of Japan, and Ukraine Yuliya Tkach, with whom she has traded gold medals with over the last two World Championships, to contend with for Rio gold.
But in a shocking turn, the World champion Battsetseg was upset by American Elena Pirozhkova in the quarter-finals, and Tkach didnât advance past the second round. Meanwhile Kawai dominated in her preliminaries, only giving up two points in three bouts en-route to the gold medal match, where she met Mariya Mamoshuk of Belarus who was making her Olympic dÃ©but. The Belarussian had earlier beaten Kazakhstan Yekaterina Larionova 8-2, Sweden Henna Johansson 7-2 and American Pirozhkova 3-2. However, Kawai was too much for the Olympic rookie, and she ran out the 3-0 winner, and with victory came Japan fourth wrestling gold medal in Rio. She celebrated in style by delivering two fireman carry takedowns on her coach Kazuhito Sakae after he ran up to congratulate her after her victory. Needless to say, the video of it went viral!
Larionova won her bronze medal over Pirozhkova, while Poland Monika Michalik, the four-time European champion competing in her third Olympic Games, defeated Inna Trazhukova of Russia, for the other bronze.

Competitors losing to the finalists entered repechage tournament for bronze medals.,na,"There was only one favorite in the women middleweight freestyle wrestling event at the 2012 Summer Olympics: Kaori Icho of Japan. Aside from a forfeit at the 2007 Asian Championships, the Japanese wrestler had won her last 149 matches, held the only two Olympic crowns in the event (2004 and 2008), and was a seven-time World Champion, having won the event in every tournament since 2002, with the exception of the oddly-held 2008 edition and 2009, when she had taken a break from wrestling. No other competitor came close to matching her dominance. She breezed through the tournament to meet Jing Ruixue of China in the final, who had been World Champion in the non-Olympic 67 kg division in 2006 and 2007, runner-up in the middleweight in 2005, and a bronze medalist at the most recent edition. The battle for the crown was almost no contest: Icho had the first round won by the first thirty seconds, having already scored three points on Jing. In the second period, Icho reversed a near-takedown by the leg to score one point and scored another in the final twenty seconds, giving Japan both wrestling medals of the day, following Hitomi Obara earlier victory in the flyweight division.
The bronze medal matches were somewhat less one-sided. Canadian Martine Dugrenier, thrice World Champion (2008, 2009, and 2010) and thrice runner-up (2005, 2006, 2007) in the 67 kg category, fought in her second Olympics as a middleweight competitor, but had the misfortune of drawing against Icho in the first round. In the battle for the bronze medal she put up a good fight against Soronzonboldyn Battsetseg of Mongolia, the 2010 World Champion in the 59 kg class (also non-Olympic), but was unable to match her opponent skill or score any points, losing 0-2 and 0-1 and giving Mongolia its first Olympic medal in wrestling since 1980. The battle for the final podium spot was perhaps the most hard fought, pitting Monika Michalik of Poland, twice bronze-medalist at the World Championships (2006 and 2007) and thrice gold medalist at the European Championships (2003 in the 59 kg division, 2005, 2009), against Lyubov Volosova of Russia, three-time World Championship runner-up (2001 in the 56 kg class, 2008, 2009) and once bronze medalist (2010) and twice European Champion (2006 at 56 kg, 2010). The first round went to par terre, where Michalik drew the advantaged position and scored on her opponent. Volosova had her revenge, however, outscoring the Polish wrestler in the second period 3-1 and converting the advantage in a third-round par terre to win the bronze.

She won her first two matches by falls but then met Canada Martine Dugrenier in the semi-finals and was fortunate to win. The two wrestlers split the first two periods, and tied in the third period, 1-1, but Icho advanced because she had scored the last point. This advanced Icho to the final against Russian Alyona Kartashova, who was the current European Champion. Icho defended her gold medal easily, winning both the first two periods without giving up a point.
Icho would return in 2012 and win her third consecutive gold medal at London. She also would win World Championships in 2010-11 and 2013-14, and through 2014 had won over 150 consecutive matches. Her sister, Chiharu, won Olympic silver medals as a flyweight in 2004 and 2008.

The defending Olympic champion also won three of the last four World Championships (2011, 2013, 2015) and a bronze medal in 2014, and was considered by some to be the best freestyle wrestler in the world.
But in an unimaginable upset, Burroughs was beaten 3-2 in his match against world-ranked number two, Russia Aniuar Geduyev â a match worthy of a final, and then hours later lost an unthinkable 11-1 in his next match to Bekzod Abdurakhmonov of Uzbekistan. Burroughs had lost twice in one day after losing twice, period, in his international career, and was off the Olympic podium. He wept in his wife arms.
In the 74 kg final, which saw several medical timeouts, the World bronze medalist Geduyev dominated the first period to take a 6-0 lead over the 21-year-old Iranian Hassan Yazdani, who entered the 2016 Rio Olympics having already been crowned 2014 World Junior champion and 2015 World Championship 70 kg silver medalist.  Yazdani was able to take advantage of the fact that Geduyev was bleeding profusely from his forehead and not able to make the moves he normally might have been able to. Coming through with three takedowns in the last period, the final one coming with eight seconds on the clock, Yazdani won the gold medal in dramatic fashion.
European champion Soner DemirtaÅ of Turkey blanked Galymzhan Userbayev from Kazakhstan 6-0 in the first bronze-medal match, earning his first world-level medal, while Azerbaijan CÉbrayÄ±l HÉsÉnov bounced back from his semi-final loss, beating Abdurakhmonov 9-7 for the other bronze.

His greatest rival was Russia Denis Tsargush, two-time World (2009 and 2010) and three-time European Champion (2010-2012) in the category. Another strong challenger was Sadegh Goudarzi of Iran, the Asian Champion in 2009 and 2012 and World Championship runner-up the past two years.
Burroughs and Tsargush were drawn in the same half, where the American edged out the Russian in the semi-finals, while Goudarzi was the winner of his bracket and advanced to challenge the World Champion in the gold medal match. Both wrestlers were extremely agile fighters, but Borroughs was quicker in each round, ably dodging all of the Iranians attacks and scoring in the final seconds of both rounds to win the United Statesâ first wrestling gold medal of the Games.
Of the two wrestlers who met in the first bronze medal match, Soslan Tigiyev of Uzbekistan was the more heralded, having won a silver medal at the 2008 Games and bronze at the 2006 Asian Games. His opponent, GÃ¡bor Hatos of Hungary, had finished 15th at the 2004 edition and had bronze medals from the 2006 European Championships and the 2010 World Championships. Tigiyev won the first round with a takedown and drew the advantaged position in a second round par terre, which he was able to convert not only to a point, but a bronze medal as well. For the final podium spot Tsargush faced Matt Gentry of Canada, a Pan American bronze medalist in 2007 and 2011 who finished 18th at the 2008 Olympics. As expected, the Russian had little trouble scoring against the Canadian, winning the match, and the bronze medal, 1-0 and 2-0 in the first and second rounds respectively.
In November 2012, Soslan Tigiyev (UZB) was revealed to have a positive test for turinabol (dehydrochloromethyltestosterone), and was disqualified, losing his bronze medal. Hungarian GÃ¡bor Hatos, who lost to Tigiyev in the repÃªchage final, was advanced to the bronze medal position. At Beijing in 2008, Tigiyev had also won a bronze medal in this class, but in October 2016, he was revealed to have a positive test for turinabol (dehydrochloromethyltestosterone), and was disqualified, losing his bronze medal.

His star had dimmed a bit, however, and he was not chosen for the 2007 World Championships, which were won by Makhach Murtazaliyev. Saytiyev and Murtazaliyev wrestled off for the spot at Beijing, won by Saytiyev. Saytiyev made it to the finals in Beijing, where he faced Uzbeki Soslan Tigiyev. Tigiyev won the first period but Saytiyev dramatically recovered to win the last two periods and the gold medal. At London in 2012 Tigiyev appeared to add a bronze medal to his Beijing silver, but he would be disqualified for a doping positive for methylhexaneamine. Saytiyev gold medal in Beijing made him the only Olympic wrestler to win three gold medals in the same class, but not consecutively.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected.

Belarussian Murad Gaydarov was upgraded to a silver medal while Romanian Ètefan GheorghiÈÄ received the bronze medal. Tigiyev brother, Taymuraz Tigiyev, who competed for Kazakhstan, had also originally won a silver medal in 96 kg freestyle, but was also disqualified in October 2016 for turinabol.

Ãebi had been World Champion in 2009 and 2010, but was unseated in 2011 by Vlasov, who had just made the jump from the junior to the senior edition of the competition. While these two were the favorites for gold, attention was also given to Arsen Julfalakyan of Armenia who was vying to repeat the feat of his father Levon, who won a gold medal in the lightweight Greco-Roman category in 1988. Arsen had been eliminated in the 1/8 finals of the 2008 Summer Games, but had improved significantly since then with second and third-place finishes at the 2010 and 2011 World Championships respectively. If he won the gold medal in London, he would become part of the first father-son Olympic wrestling champions. The other 2011 World Championship bronze medalist, Neven Å½ugaj, was aiming to become the first Croatian Olympic wrestling medalist, while Christophe GuÃ©not was the only returning Olympic medalist from the 2008 Games.
In a shocking turn of events, Ãebi was eliminated in his opening match by Robert Rosengren, an unheralded wrestler from Sweden. The only question now was who would face Vlasov in the final, a call answered by Julfalakyan who, unlike Vlasov, never lost a round on his journey to the gold medal match. In the end, however, Vlasov demonstrated clear superiority over Julfalakyan, successfully defending against his opponent aggressive style and bringing each round to par terre, where his strength gave him the advantage in both the top and bottom positions. Vlasov successfully flipped, then defended, in this stage, winning the match in two rounds and claiming the top podium spot.
The first bronze medal match pitted Aleksandras KazakeviÄius of Lithuania against Mark O. Madsen of Denmark, both veteran Olympians from 2008. Madsen was a three-time silver medalist at the World Championships (2005, 2007, and 2009) while KazakeviÄius was fighting at a disadvantage, having injured his right eye in an earlier bout. Nonetheless the Lithuanian maintained his defenses throughout, bringing his opponent to par terre both times, and was able to successfully defend, and then convert, to win the match in two rounds and capture the bronze medal. In the second match, Aleksandr Kikinyov of Belarus, who had competed in the 2004 Summer Games and had a bronze medal from the 2009 World Championships, faced Emin ÆhmÉdov of Azerbaijan, a rookie on the international scene. Each wrestler was able to convert their par terre top advantage to a point in the first two rounds, leading to a third round where, with points and cautions tied, a ball was drawn and ÆhmÉdov was given the opportunity to choose his position in the third par terre. Selecting the top, the Azerbaijani was able to drive Kikinyov out of the ring for a point, although this ruling was unclear and challenged at first. Even when replays showed clearly that the Belarusian had stepped outside, however, Kikinyov refused to admit defeat or shake hands with his opponent. Regardless of these protestations, ÆhmÉdov was awarded the bronze medal.

But the gold medal final was not only another old rivalry, but a rematch between Vlasov and 2015 World silver medalist Mark O. Madsen of Denmark â the five-time World Championship medalist who was also beaten by Vlasov at the 2012 Olympic Games, where he was fifth.

In the semi-finals, Vlasov was in the lead when he was choked unconscious by BoÅ¾o StarÄeviÄ of Croatia on a legal move, and while officials awarded StarÄeviÄ two points, they stopped the bout when they realized Vlasov had blacked out.

But he eventually sailed on his own, going to Paris to meet his brother, Sumner, who was shooting that summer in the Gastinne-Renette Galleries.  They were unable to find out much about the competitions, except that one event was to be a revolver contest over 30 metres.  Sumner Paine brought along everything he could find in Paris, including a Colt Army revolver, a Smith & Wesson Russian revolver, and a pocket gun for each of them, as well as John .22 calibre Stevens pistol and Sumner .22 Wurfflein pistol.  They also brought along 3,500 rounds of ammunition, which proved to ample, as they eventualy only fired a total of 96 rounds.
The Colt Army revolver was the famous gun of the old west, also known as the Frontier Six-Shooter.  The Smith & Wesson Russian or No. 3 Single Action revolver was the usually the choice of the knowledgable pistol shooter of the era.  The gun was made in large quantities, as the Smith & Wesson plant had received huge orders from Russia beginning in 1870, and almost 250,000 had been manufactured by the time of the Athens Olympics.  The Wurfflein pistol was a single-shot pistol with a tip-up barrel, hinged at the front end of the frame.  They were popular in shooting events in the 19th century, winning many matches and setting many records.
The shooters shot in groups of three.  The first group was Pantelis Karasvedas, Sidney Merlin and Sumner Paine.  The second group was Sanidis, Aristovoulos Petmezas, and John Paine.  The composition of the subsequent groups is not known.
This was the first pistol event of the 1896 Olympics and the Paines outclassed their competitors, despite the fact that they had difficulty with the conditions.  The sunlight was almost blinding and they had problems seeing the black target with its white center.  In addition, both of their pistols had been sighted for 50 yards, not 25 metres, and they had to make some minor sighting adjustments.

On 13 June 1929, Snook claimed that Hix asked him to divorce his wife and marry her, threatening to kill his wife and child if she was refused. Snook confessed to then beating Hix several times with a hammer before severing her jugular vein with a pocketknife to, in his own words, ârelieve her sufferingâ.

The cross-country ski run was not prepared, and was made by the leading Swiss team. The Czechoslovak participant Karel DvoÅÃ¡k described the weather of the day as extremely mild with temperatures of about 0Â° C at the starting point at the upper cableway station (2,486 m) on top of the Corviglia in the morning. The participants wore military equipment, 10 kg of baggage on the back and a military rifle. Only the officers, the patrol leaders, had pistols and did not compete in shooting. At the shooting range they had to shoot on three rubber balloons at a distance of 150 m. Every hit gave a bonus of 1 minute for the team. Switzerland won fairly easily, by three minutes over Finland. Switzerland had by far the best ski time, about 7 minutes ahead of the Finns, but Finland received 9 shooting bonus minutes, while the Swiss had only 5. Sweden also outskiied the Finns, but the Finnish dominance with the rifle moved the Swedes back to third place.

The Japanese Masahiro Akimoto come very close, but ended 0.7 points behind Deckert and Yagi.

Two years later neither of the stars of Albertville, Toni Nieminen and Martin HÃ¶llwarth, could qualify for Lillehammer as both men suffered a disintegration of their form. The men who had replaced the two men at the top of the ski jumping rankings included 1993 world champion Masahiko Harada of Japan, the young Austrian Andi Goldberger and the German pair of Thoma and WeiÃflog. The biggest story of the 1994 ski jumping competition did not concern any of those previously but instead centered about the host nation Espen Bredesen. Bredesen Olympic debut in 1992 was a humiliating failure as he finished last on the small hill and 57th out of 59th on the large hill and he was heavily criticized at home in Norway. After initially struggling to cope with the switch from the classical to the V-technique his results quickly improved in the 1992-93 season and he won both titles at the Norwegian Championships, the Holmenkollen event, the large hill title at the World Championship and the Pre-Olympic test event.
His performance in Lillehammer was as sensational as his exploits in Albertville had been disastrous. Bredesen first round leap may not have been as long as that of fellow Norwegian Lasse Ottesen but his style marks came close to perfection and he led at halfway. The pressure for a home victory had already lifted when Bredesen stood at the start gate for his second jump as Ottesen had already guaranteed a Norwegian gold medal but Ottesen hopes for the title were thwarted when Bredesen hung in the air then landed safely at the 104 metre mark. For Norwegian ski jumping the result of this event came as a redemption following the events of Albertville which saw a Norwegian team record a series of disastrous performances as they struggled to make changes to the technical side of the sport. The bronze medal was won by Dieter Thoma of Germany but his margin over the next four jumpers was just 2.5 points.

If he was to be challenged in Salt Lake City then conventional thinking said that this challenge might come from 2001 world champion Adam MaÅysz of Poland.
Although he had performed consistently throughout the season few would have picked the bespectacled Swiss Simon Ammann to feature but he led the way after the first round as his superior style marks helped him push into a small lead. With MaÅysz having already guaranteed a rare winter medal for Poland only Hannawald and Amman were left to jump. Although the German leap was half-a-metre longer than Amman it failed to close the points deficit and Switzerland first Olympic ski jumping title was confirmed.

But this time they had great expectations for their excellent ski jumping team. The team was composed of four experienced jumpers, all of whom had shown good form early in the season. The big star was undoubtedly 28-year old Yukio Kasaya. He had taken a silver medal in the Normal Hill at the 1970 World Championships behind double gold medalist Gari Napalkov of Soviet. In the Four Hill Tournament at the beginning of the Olympic season, Kasaya had won the first three competitions. After that the Japanese team returned home to Japan to prepare for their home Olympics. Kasaya would probably have won the overall combined tournament easily, instead the Norwegian Ingolf Mork was the overall winner due to Kasaya absence in the fourth competition. Also the fact that all jumpers of the Japanese team came from Hokkaido made the local interest for the Normal Hill competition, three days after the opening of the Games, enormous.
After the first round the Japanese audience went wild: The Japanese quartet held the first four positions! Kasaya made a perfect jump of 84.0 m, the longest of the day, but was closely followed by Seiji Aochi, who jumped 83.5 m. In third place was Akitsugu Konno from Sapporo, followed by the fourth Japanese, Takashi Fujisawa, the silver medalist in the Large Hill from the World Championships in Oslo six years earlier. Best of the non-Japanese jumpers was the Swede Rolf Nordgren followed by another surprise man, the 19-year old Pole Wojciech  Fortuna.
The Japanese team was under great pressure from the home crowd before the start of the second round. Kasaya kept cool, had the best jump of all in the second round and won by a margin of almost 10 points. Konno made the second best jump of the second round and advanced to silver, and Aochi secured a clean medal sweep for Japan, the first in ski jumping since the Norwegian team made it in 1948. Only Fujisawa could not repeat his first jump, he missed totally and fell down from fourth to 23rd in the final ranking. Mork advanced from 14th after the first round, being the best non-Japanese in fourth place, and defending Olympic Champion JiÅÃ­ RaÅ¡ka climbed from 13th to a final fifth place. Fortuna kept his sixth place from the first round, and the double World 1970 Champion Napalkov had to be content with a seventh place.
Kasaya and his teammates were celebrated as national heroes, Japan having avenged the disappointing results from their male speed skating sprinters in the 500 m from the day before.

In the Normal Hill competition, the young Soviet jumper Anatoly Zheglanov took an early lead with an excellent jump of 79.5 m. The Austrian Baldur Preiml, starting 28th, produced the longest jump of the day with 80.0 m and was still in the lead until one of the last starters, Czechoslovakian JiÅÃ­ RaÅ¡ka jumped 79.0 m with superb style and bettered Preindl total points. The 21-year old Finn Topi Mattila was lying third after the first round, beating Zheglanov point score with a 78.0 m jump. Wirkola was a disappointing sixth.
In the second round the jumps were considerably shorter. Austrian Reinhold Bachler produced the longest jump of the round with 76.0 m and advanced from eighth to the silver medal position. RaÅ¡ka had a more mediocre jump of 72.5 m but claimed the first ever gold medal in ski jumping for Czechoslovakia. Preindl was able to hold off Wirkola in the battle for the bronze medal.

Masahiko Harada, the world champion on the large hill, was joined by 1998 Four hills champion Kazuyoshi Funaki and Hiroya Saito, who had produced an impressive run of form in the early part of 1998. Standing between Japan and the ultimate prize were a host of strong European challengers. World Cup winner PrimoÅ¾ Peterka hoped to win a first winter medal for Slovenia, World Champion Janne Ahonen flew the flag for Finland and spearheaded by Dieter Thoma, the German team were once again strong.
At the halfway point in the competition the Japanese dream appeared to be coming true.
Harada, with a leap of 91.5 m, held the lead and his three teammates all placed within the top seven. The foreign threat came from the fast improving Austrian Andreas WidhÃ¶lzl and Jani Soininen, a Finn with a reputation for producing wildly varying distances within the same competition.
Kazuyoshi Funaki overtook WidhÃ¶lzl with his second round and led with only the two first round leaders to jump.  Soininen leap, though not as far as Funaki, was enough to put him a point of Funaki but this left a clear opportunity for Harada to clinch the title. Needing a jump of around 88 m to win, Harada fell short and posted just 84.5 m sending him down from 1st to 5th and, for the second successive Games, the image of a distraught Harada was flashed around the World.

In 1975 he had a serious knee injury, but was back on the international top in the Olympic season.
In the Normal hill competition on the Toni-Seelos-Schanze in Seefeld, Aschenbach made an excellent first jump of 84.5 m, the longest in the competition.

The two other jumpers on the East German team, Bernd Eckstein and Henry GlaÃ, were lying in sixth and seventh place, and all four Austrians were among the 12 best. No doubt, the Olympic ski jumping events in 1976 seemed to be an East German-Austrian affair.
The second round brought no changes, Aschenbach and Danneberg secured a double for East Germany, again making the two best jumps of the round, and Schnabel held his bronze medal position.

Defending Olympic Champion Helmut Recknagel was still a major force in ski jumping, winning gold on the Large Hill and bronze on the Normal Hill in the 1962 World Championships.
Wearing start number 1, the 21-year old Norwegian Hans Olav SÃ¸rensen was in the lead with a 76 m-jump until Engan, with start number 43, made an excellent jump of 79 m and took over the lead. But then the Czechoslovakian jumper Josef MatouÅ¡ surprised everybody with 80.5 m, the longest jump of the day to take over the lead. Kankkonen, jumping last of the 53 participants, missed his first jump and was a distant 29th after the first round.
In the second round, a young Norwegian, 22-year-old Torgeir BrandtzÃ¦g, who had made a poor first jump, surprised with an excellent 79 m-jump. Engan made another good jump at 78.5 m and took over the lead, since MatouÅ¡ was not able to follow up his first round jump. Then Kankkonen made the best jump of the day, 80 m and with high style points, but he needed another good jump to be in contention for the gold medal. After round two Engan was in a clear lead with 224.4 points, MatouÅ¡ in second 6.2, points behind and the consistent German Dieter Neuendorf in third place.

In the Four Hills Tournament in the Olympic season another teenager hit the headlines, as East Germany Jens WeiÃflog won the tournament after impressive jumping. Those two would dominate international ski jumping for the rest of the 1980s, and they had more in common: They were both extremely thin, with a body weight of around 54 kilograms. This represented the start of a trend, as in the following years a rising number of ski jumpers joined the international top class with a bodyweight below 60 kg.
In the Normal hill competition in Sarajevo, NykÃ¤nen was in the lead after the first round, producing a jump of 91.0 m with style points between 17 and 18.  WeiÃflog was in second, jumping one meter shorter than his Finnish rival. Another youngster, 20-year old Andreas Bauer of  West Germany, was in third place after a jump of 87.0 m, but well behind the two favorites. The competition was of mediocre quality, mostly due to unstable wind conditions.
In the second round, Stefan Stannarius from East Germany took an early lead after a good 89.5 m jump. Jari Puikkonen from Finland, Olympic bronze medalist in the large hill 1980 and runner-up in the World Championships 1982, made the best jump of the day, 91.5 m, and advanced from 21st place after the first round to the top of the leaderboard. WeiÃflog could do no more than 87.0 m, but took the lead, 3.4 points ahead of Puikkonen. NykÃ¤nen, jumping next-to last of the 58 competitors, could secure the Olympic gold with a decent jump of around 86 m, but he failed, landing at 84.0 m, and had to settle for silver, giving the gold to WeiÃflog. The reigning World champion on the Normal hill, Austrian Armin Kogler, had an extremely bad day, ending in 52nd place.

Neither NykÃ¤nen or WeiÃflog held the world title, that championship having been won by Czechoslovakia JiÅÃ­ Parma in 1985 but  NykÃ¤nen would arrive at Calgary as the holder of the prestigious Four Hills tournament. Norwegian hopes were pinned on World Cup holder Vegard Opaas whilst the Austrian pairing of Andreas Felder and Ernst Vettori had been consistently amongst the world best since the last Olympic Games.
After the completion of the first round the leader board had a strange look to it. It may have been no surprise to find NykÃ¤nen in the gold medal position but the top fifteen included only one Austrian, no Germans from either side of the border and no Norwegians. WeiÃflog did make the lower region of the top twenty but Opaas, the top Norwegian, languished all the way down in twenty-sixth place. Czechoslovakian and Yugoslavian jumpers were the top performers on the first jump with the two nations combining to produce eight of the top thirteen at the half way mark.
NykÃ¤nen second jump was a copy of his first and no one could challenge the mastery of the twenty four year old Finn. If there was little drama in the challenge for the Olympic title the same could not be said of the other medals with less than a point covering the next three jumpers. Pavel Ploc maintained the excellent form he had shown on the World Cup circuit to narrowly place second ahead of his less well known team-mate JiÅÃ­ Malec. While NykÃ¤nen feat was covered widely by the world press another jumper equaled him in terms of media coverage. Eddie Edwards was a British ski jumper who had only two years of jumping behind him and was, at 74 kg and wearing a thick pair of spectacles, an unlikely competitor. His two jumps, both of 55 m, were well behind even of those of the next-to-last jumper.

But the lasting memory of a magnificent men contest was the two British brothers lying side-by-side on the ground after crossing the finishing line congratulating each other as they improved on their 2012 performance of gold and bronze, which they had now upgraded to gold and silver, with Alistair becoming the first triathlete to win back-to-back Olympic golds.

New Zealand Shane Reed led the swimming, but was not a factor thereafter. Dirk Bockel of Luxembourg and Belgium Axel Zeebroek led off the bike leg, but weak running left them far from the medals. Starting the run, the favorites were back around 10th place with GÃ³mez and Canada Simon Whitfield, the 2000 gold medalist, working their way up the field. They were marked by New Zealander Bevan Docherty, the Athina silver medalist, and some German triathlete named Jan Frodeno, who was little known but had been second at the 2007 Europeans. Into the final straight, Frodeno sprinted hard and dropped Whitfield to win a very unexpected gold medal. Whitfield trailed, five seconds back in second, while the bronze medal went to Docherty, with GÃ³mez eight seconds off the podium in fourth. He would come back in 2012 and win a silver medal at London.
Whitfield had controversially used a domestique during the event, his countryman, Colin Jenkins. Whitfield drafted off Jenkins in the swim and bike portions, and then took off to contest the medals. Jenkins finished, but jogged in on the run, with the slowest run time of 38:39 and was the last finisher in 50th place.

Without double champion Alistair Brownlee and Ironman superstar Jan Frodeno, the short-distance field was searching for a new hero. During the COVID pandemic only a very limited number of international races could be held, so the actual condition of the competitors was basically uncertain. The 2020 World Champion, with three World Cup wins in autumn 2020, was the Frenchman Vincent Luis, while the Norwegian Kristian Blummenfelt and Jonathan Brownlee won the two World Cups in May 2021. The winner of the World Series event in Leeds one month before the games was Alex Yee.
For swimming the men had to navigate the warm 30 degree water in Tokyo Odaiba Bay, right next to the Rainbow Bridge. Outside of the water, however, the conditions were acceptable with an air temperature of 27 degrees and a humidity of 67 percent.
The race started with an incident. While a camera boat was still filming the participants, the race management gave the start command. Part of the field jumped into the water, but the way for many athletes was blocked by the boat, so they stopped at the pontoon. Several triathletes had already started swimming and had return to the start, which took a considerable amount of time. The race got underway safely around 10 minutes later.
Vincent Luis was the first out of the water after the first swim lap of 950 metres heading back to the second lap of 550 metres. The pack, however, was only seconds behind. He was able to hold this position and finished swimming in front of Dmitry Polyansky and Jonas Schomburg.
The bike part started with a small lead group of five athletes, which eventually grew larger in the first lap with a few athletes sprinting inside to form a pack of nine, but a second chase group was only a few seconds behind. In the fourth lap these groups finally merged. Stefan Zachaus tried to escape, but was caught up quickly. Now a third group also joined, so that almost the entire field rode together for the rest of the race. In the middle of the bike course Schomburg had massive bad luck. Luis Knabl tore off the rear derailleur right in front of him and Schomburg lost contact with the main group. The pace slowed down a bit, so that Swiss Andrea Salvisberg was able to pull away, opening a lead of 21 seconds at the end of lap five. This gap was reduced to only 14 seconds out of the second transition zone after the bike.
Salvisberg was soon caught on the run and an elimination race began. Alex Yee headed the field now for most of the run and gradually accelerated, but could not get rid of all his rivals. With 1 km to go in the last run lap, Kristian Blummenfelt dropped Yee and initiated the decisive attack. Yee could not match the Norwegian speed, who began celebrating his greatest career success 200 metres before the line and was overwhelmed by his win at the finish before he was carted away from the finish area in a wheelchair. Behind the two top finishers New Zealand Hayden Wilde crossed the line in a comfortable third position. For Norway it was the first triathlon medal in Olympic history and the first summer gold since 2012.

Austria Kate Allen was a weak swimmer and finished the swim over two minutes behind Harrop, 44th of the 50 starters.  Allen lost almost another minute to Harrop on the bike, and started the run in 28th place, 2:48 back.  But Kate Allen was by far the best runner in the event.

Snowsill and Fernandes came out of the water close together, and rode together in the same pack during the cycling. Starting the run they were together in a fairly large group, with little to choose, but Snowsill stomped on the field in the 10 km run. She covered the course in 33:17, more than a minute ahead of Fernandes, who ran 34:21, as Snowsill won the gold medal with about a 67-second margin of victory.

France Isabelle Mouthon-Michellys won the bike leg, and led starting the run, with Jones in 5th place, and Switzerland Brigitte McMahon in 8th.  But Jones and McMahon were two of the best runners in the field.  Jones finished the bike leg in 5th place, but a very fast bike-run transition enabled her to start the run in the lead, with McMahon 10 seconds behind.  But McMahon excellent running allowed her to quickly make up that margin.  They ran shoulder-to-shoulder for most of the last half of the run, with the Australian fans madly cheering on Jones.  But gradually McMahon edged away in the in-run to the finish line.  The run leg was won by almost a minute by Britain Stephanie Forrester, but her weak swim and bike left her in only 15th place.

Jorgensen also came into the Games as the 2014 and 2015 World Triathlon Series champion and between April 2014 and April 2016 had enjoyed a run of 17 consecutive wins and was a clear favorite to lift gold in Rio.
However, the reigning European Games champion, Switzerland Nicola Spirig Hug was out to thwart the American pair and retain the Olympic title she won at London 2012. The other two London medalists, Lisa NordÃ©n, Sweden (silver) and Erin Densham, Australia (bronze) were also in the Rio field and were medal contenders.
South Africa Mari Rabie held a slender one second lead after the opening swim, and after the transition following the cycle ride, she had increased it to two seconds but with Nicola Spirig and Gwen Jorgensen within four seconds of her, she knew that lead would soon disappear once they hit the road, and it did.  After being virtually neck-and-neck with Jorgensen throughout the competition, Spirig knew that her rivals strongest discipline was the run and that is where the title was eventually decided when the American pulled away on the fourth and final lap of the 10km run to win by a massive 40 seconds, the second biggest winning margin after Emma Snowsill win by just over one minute at Beijing in 2008.
In the sprint to the finish for the bronze medal, Vicky Holland won a first medal for Great Britain women, edging out her friend, training partner, team-mate and flat mate Non Stanford. The first thing Holland said to Stanford as they crossed the line was: âIâm so sorry.â Competing in her fourth Olympics, Spirig had the honour of being the first multiple Olympic female triathlete, adding her Rio silver to London gold, and Vicky Holland bronze meant Britain had won three of the six medals on offer in Rio, the first time any one nation had won so many triathlon medals at one celebration.

The expected typhoon passed over Tokyo but hit the coast of Japan as only a light tropical storm and did not result in a postponement.
The favorites included the 2020 world champion, Georgia Taylor-Brown from Great Britain, and the 2016 Olympic bronze medallist, Vicky Holland. The 2021 top event of the World Championship series in Leeds was won by Maya Kingma, and 39-year-old Nicola Spirig Hug focused on winning her third Olympic medal after gold in 2012 and silver in 2016. The race started 15 minutes late due to pouring rain, and the conditions turned out to be extremely demanding, especially later on the wet bike track.
Shortly before the start Yuliya Yelistratova caused a scandal, when the Ukrainian was excluded from the race on suspicion of doping. During a control on 5 June, a prohibited substance was discovered, but only became known now. Yelistratova was temporarily suspended and not allowed to start. From the first moment Jess Learmonth was pushing the swim pace and led the field after the first lap of 950 metres. The Briton kept up the high speed and was also the first to get out of the water after the shorter second lap. Behind her were Summer Rappaport and Vittoria Lopes.
A large bike group formed after the transition. Several crashes on the slippery surface occurred in the early laps, especially while navigating tight corners. After the first lap of 5 km a top group of seven formed. Taylor-Brown now took the lead most of the time, with the leaders already more than a minute ahead of their pursuers, but Spirig-Hug tried desperately to bridge the gap. Right at the end of the bike phase Taylor-Brown suffered bad luck with a rear-wheel puncture, but she recovered to finish only 22 seconds behind the four bike leaders.
Out of the transition zone Duffy was about to take the lead, with only American Katie Zaferes close to her in the run. Laura Lindemann was third but soon lost contact. After the first of four laps Duffy was 17 seconds ahead of Zaferes who was comfortably second. Duffy continued to increase her speed, never looking back. At the beginning of the last lap Duffy was more than a minute ahead and easily won gold. The battle for second place was decided in the last lap with Taylor-Brown overtaking Zaferes, who took bronze.
For the British overseas territory of Bermuda, with only 64,000 inhabitants, Duffy victory was their first Olympic gold medal and only the second medal after bronze for boxer Clarence Hill in MontrÃ©al in 1976.

Britain put their hopes on Helen Jenkins, the 2008 and 2011 World Champion, but she struggled with an injury coming into the Games, which hampered her training. Switzerland Nicola Spirig had already won two of the stages of the ITU World Series and was favored with Jenkins hurt, although Australia Emma Moffatt was expected to challenge for gold.
The run was four laps of a 21/2 km course, and as the leaders entered the final lap, there was a lead pack of five athletes â Spirig, Jenkins, Lisa NordÃ©n (SWE), Erin Densham (AUS), and Sarah Groff (USA), as Moffatt had crashed on the bike ride and would not finish. Jenkins was dropped first by the leaders as she could not keep pace. Groff held on until about 700 metres from the finish but then was dropped, leaving Spirig, NordÃ©n and Densham to contest the medals. Spirig and NordÃ©n ran shoulder-to-shoulder and gradually dropped Densham within the last 200 metres. The two leaders could not be separated and neither was ever able to get an entire body width in front, as the lead changed hands several times. At the end they were in an all-out sprint, still with nothing to separate them.
As they hit the line, seemingly together, it was unclear who had won. Finally, the finish photo determined that Spirig had won the gold medal, although they were given the same time and the margin was later revealed to be only 0.009 seconds, a ridiculous margin to determine a champion in a 2-hour race.

The omnium was much awaited as it contained some of the best endurance riders in the world including the 2019 and 2020 world omnium champions Campbell Stewart of New Zealand and France Benjamin Thomas. British bronze medallist from the last two World Championships, Ethan Hayter and Matthew Walls, were also in the field as was the 2012 Olympic champion, and Rio bronze medallist, Lasse Norman Hansen, fresh from his team pursuit silver in Tokyo.

The same three riders occupied the top three paces in the newly added Tempo Race, with Van Schip first, Thomas second and Walls third, but the British rider retained the overall lead.

At Rio, it consisted of six endurance events over two days, now it was just four events over one gruelling day. Laura Kenny was aiming to win her third consecutive Olympic omnium in the last track event of the 2020 Games. She was also hoping to add to her total of five gold medals, and was inspired after seeing husband Jason win his seventh gold a short while earlier.
Standing in Kenny way were some extremely good cyclists in this four-discipline event. Kirsten Wild was seen as the biggest threat to Kenny domination. The Dutch rider was the 2019 omnium world champion, as well as winning the madison world title that year, and again in 2020. The 2019 and 2020 World Championships silver medallist Letizia Paternoster of Italy was another rider in with a chance, as was Jennifer Valente, a member of the USA pursuit team that won Olympic bronze just a few days earlier. The home crowd had their own favourite in the reigning world champion Yumi Kajihara.
Kenny chance of retaining her title was severely disrupted when she was sent hurtling to the track in a multi-rider pile up on the penultimate lap of the opening scratch race. She did not finish the race and was one of nine riders each awarded 16 points, but America Valente got the maximum 40 points with Kajihara taking second on 38, and Wild finishing third for 36 points. Kenny came back to take maximum points in the new tempo race but still trailed Valente by 20 points. France Clara Copponi took maximum points from the elimination race while Kenny only scored 13 in what was regarded as her best element. Going into the final race, the points race, Valente led by just two points from Kajihara with Norway Anita Stenberg a further 14 points behind.
Despite being the top scorer in the points race with 24, it was too much ground for Laura Kenny to make up and she finished sixth. Valente survived a crash in the latter part of the points race, but her 14 points in the last race gave her a total of 124, which was good enough to take gold. Kajihara could not capitalise and scored just two points to finish four points behind Valente. Kirsten Wild scored well and got to within two points of the local favourite to take the bronze medal.
Jennifer Valente won a third consecutive omnium medal for the USA, but it was their first gold after Sarah Hammer bronzes in 2012 and 2016. It was also America first track cycling gold of the Tokyo Games and their first Olympic gold on the track since Marty Nothstein won the individual sprint at Sydney in 2000.

Del Colombo attacked the injured leg, and scored a koka, the first score given up by Yamashita for years. But Yamashita countered with ouchi-gari for yuko and went straight to a kuzure-kami-shiho-gatame hold-down for ippon to advance to the final. In the final he met Egyptian Mohamed Ali Rashwan, who had also won all his pool matches by ippon. As he came out for the final, Yamashita was limping worse than ever, having torn muscles in his right calf. Rashwan was quickly overcome, despite the injury, Yamashita using yoko-shiho-gatame for ippon in only 1:05. At the medal ceremony, Rashwan had to help Yamashita up onto the podium. In September 1985, Rashwan was awarded the International Fair Play Award, based on his supposed refusal to attack Yamashita injured leg in the final. Films of the match, however, reveal that not only did Rashwan attack Yamashita injured leg, it was his first move in the final.

The start of the first group was at 1:00 PM. When at 5:00 PM. only a few yachts had circled the upper buoy, a cancellation was considered, however, by 7:00 PM, seven boats had crossed the finish line. The two first places were taken by small boats with the British boat âScotiaâ (1/2-1 ton class) coming in first and the German âAschenbrÃ¶delâ (1-2 ton class). The Lerina was in third place when it abandoned the race within a few hundred metres of the finish under the mistaken belief that the race had been cancelled.

In 1951 Germany was again invited to take part internationally, and their leading couple, Ria Baran and Peter Falk, German Champions since 1947, had immediate success, winning the European title in 1951 and 1952 and the World title in 1951 in a close battle with the Kennedys. Ria and Peter married in 1951. They were also World and European champions in roller figure skating.
Ria and Peter Falk was favored for the gold medal in Oslo, and they did not disappoint their fans. This mature, elegant and creative pair was unbeaten as amateurs. At the Oslo Games Ria was 29 and Peter 30. They were the first pair showing side by side double jumps and the Lasso lift.
Karol and Peter Kennedy made a gallant try to threaten the German champions in Oslo. They started their program at a very high speed and impressed the audience at the initial stage of their program, but got problems on the last half and had to settle with the silver medal. Another sibling pair, Marianna and LÃ¡szlÃ³ Nagy of Hungary, European Champions in 1950, claimed the bronze medal.
At the World Championships in Paris one week later Ria and Peter Falk ended their amateur career in a convincing way with the clearest international victory of their career, before signing a contract with Holiday on Ice. The Kennedys had to be content with another silver medal. Paul Kennedy, apparently frustrated, assaulted a press photographer after their performance, and was suspended by both ISU and his national governing body. This incident ended the figure skating career of the colorful âKennedy Kidsâ.

After coming 5th in the 1952 Olympics, they developed their program to include new elements as twist lifts, throw jumps and overhead Lasso lifts. They defended their World title in 1955, this time in an extremely close contest with a pair which represented the European âclassical styleâ, Sissy Schwartz and Kurt Oppelt from Vienna. Schwartz/Oppelt showed excellent form two weeks before the 1956 Olympics by winning the European title in Paris with a very impressive program.
The pair skating event in Cortina 1956 turned out to be a very controversial competition. It started after the performance of the young German couple, Marika Kilius (only 12) and Franz Ningel (19). The audience was very dissatisfied with the judges and started to throw oranges and other items into the ice. The competition had to be stopped for 45 minutes to calm down the audience and clean the ice.
In a very close contest, Schwartz/Oppelt won the gold medal with the scantest possible margin. Their Canadian rivals Dafoe/Bowden made an outstanding program, but faltered on a lift, causing them to finish after their music ended. The Nagy siblings from Hungary, Marianna and LÃ¡szlÃ³, repeated their placing form Oslo 1952, winning another Olympic bronze medal.
European critics claimed that the Canadian pair overhead lifts was not covered in the rules and accordingly not permitted, but this view was strongly opposed by the North Americans. The discussions continued after the World Championships in Garmisch-Partenkirchen one week later, which ended with another close victory for the Austrian couple. Five out of nine judges had Schwartz/Oppelt in first place, the remaining four went for Dafoe/Bowden. This turned out to be the final international championship participation for both pairs involved in the controversy.
The controversy was finally settled in 1959, when a revision of the rules for pair skating was accepted by the ISU Congress.

They did not show up for the Europeans in Berlin, but reports from Vienna told that they were making great progress in training.
Emilia Rotter and LÃ¡szlÃ³ SzollÃ¡s, both Jewish, hoped to crown their career with an Olympic victory in Garmisch.

They were World Champions in 1963 and had won six straight European titles â 1959-64. At the 1963 Worlds they had defeated the Soviet husband-wife pair of Lyudmila Belousova and Oleg Protopopov, and a few weeks before the Olympics, they narrowly defeated them again. The competition in Innsbruck was very close, but the Soviet couple won with five first placements, to four for the Germans. The bronze medal was awarded to Canadians Debbi Wilkes and Guy Revell, who also received a silver medal, and another bronze medal went to American brother-sister Vivian and Ron Joseph, who placed fourth in the Official Report. Follow that?
Shortly after the Innsbruck Olympics, it was revealed that Kilius/BÃ¤umler had signed a professional contract prior to the event to perform with Holiday on Ice. This should have disqualified them as professionals, but strangely no definite action was initially taken against them by the IOC or the International Skating Union. A few weeks later they won the World Championships, defeating Belousova and Protopopov. It was felt that the West German Olympic Committee, lobbying the IOC for the 1972 Olympic bid, wanted to present themselves in the best possible manner and encouraged the German skaters to return their medals. The IOC formed a special sub-committee to examine the case, and the minutes of the Executive Committee note, âA special sub-committee under Ivar Vind had studied the case of the German figure skaters. They had been found ânon-amateursâ. Willi Daume said that âThe German NOC will do what is necessary.ââ
At the 65th IOC session the IOC passed a resolution, which was printed in the Olympic Review, volume 95, page 39, from 15 August 1966 which stated, âWe have received the silver medals back, and we will award them to the original third-place finishers. The bronze medals will be awarded to the original fourth-place finishers.â In January 1966, Kilius/BÃ¤umler returned their silver medals to the IOC. Silver medals were awarded to Wilkes and Revell by Canadian IOC Member James Worrall during the 1967 Canadian Figure Skating Championships, while the Josephs received bronze medals from USOC President Tug Wilson at a small private ceremony at the Sheraton Hotel in Chicago, during the 1966 USA Figure Skating Championships. However, no action was ever taken by the ISU, who continued to list Kilius/BÃ¤umler as silver medalists and World Champions in 1964.
However, the controversy did not end there. In 1987, the German NOC rather surreptitiously requested the return of the silver medals to Kilius and BÃ¤umler, which was in keeping with the ISU ruling as well. They asked the IOC to do this, stating that it was known that other skaters had signed similar contracts in that era. At the 1987 IOC Session in Istanbul, the IOC approved this request and the Germans received new silver medals on 5 December 1987, when German NOC president Willi Daume presented replicas of the originals to Kilius and BÃ¤umler on the German television show âSportstudioâ.
Contacted in the late 90s, Debbi Wilkes and Vivian Joseph knew nothing of this, and still thought the German pair had been disqualified. Wilkes and Revell kept their silver medals, in fact, Revell medal was buried with him after his death, and the Josephs kept their bronze medals. Thus four silver medals were eventually awarded in this event. The IOC lists did not change the standings for many years, but recognizing that two sets of silver medals have been awarded in this event, now list Kilius/BÃ¤umler and Wilkes/Revell as =2nd and as silver medalists, and have the Josephs in 3rd place with bronze medals. The ISU has never changed the original rankings, continuing to list Kilius/BÃ¤umler 2nd, Wilkes/Revell 3rd, and the Josephs 4th.
Over the next four years, Belousova and Protopopov would become the greatest pair in the world, and possibly ever to that time. They would again win gold in 1968. They wished to continue competing thru the 1972 Sapporo Olympics, but Soviet authorities ruled they were too old and shunted them to the side. In 1979, the Protopopovs defected to Switzerland and then joined professional ice shows, where they became one of the most popular attractions, continuing to skate and entertain into their 60s.

His brother, Simon, had also competed at Salt Lake City, but had failed to advance to the match racing. But by 2006 he had also become one of the top slalom boarders in the world. In the qualifying round in Torino, they confirmed their status, placing 1-2, with Simon leading Philipp by almost half a second. Once into the match racing, they easily advanced to the semi-finals, winning all their races. Philipp won his semi easily in two races, but Simon was pushed by France Mathieu Bozzetto, as they split their races, and Simon advanced, but only by 0.07 seconds for the two runs, setting up the twin brother match for the gold medal. The final was a relatively easy victory for Philipp, winning both runs rather comfortably to defend his gold medal. He also became the first snowboarder to win two Olympic gold medals. The bronze medal went to Austria Sigi Graber, who defeated Bozzetto in two straight runs.

Vic Wild grew up in Washington state and became a top Alpine snowboarder, but the Alpine snowboard events were not supported by the US ski federation, which left Wild fighting for funds to continue training. In 2010 Wild had met Russian snowboarder Alyona Zavarzina, and they married in 2011. With the marriage Wild was able to apply for Russian citizenship and their federation was more than willing to support a medal contender, so Wild began competing for Russia in 2012.
The final came down to Wild against Swiss rider Nevin Galmarini. Galmarini won the first run but Wild margin on the second run gave him the gold medal, only a few minutes after his wife, Zavarzina, won a bronze medal in the women parallel giant slalom. Slovenian Å½an KoÅ¡ir won the bronze medal race, defeating German Patrick BÃ¼ssler. Many of the favorites crashed out early. The last three gold medals had been won by Philipp Schoch (SUI) in 2002-06 and Jasey Jay Anderson (CAN) in 2010 but they both went out in the 1/8th-finals. Two Austrian favorites also struggled as 2013 World Champion Benjamin Karl went out in the quarters, and 2013/14 World Cup leader Lukas Mathies did not make it past qualifying.

Austrian Andreas Prommegger, who had dominated the event all season, was the fastest in qualifying, but was surprisingly defeated by American Chris Klug in the first elimination round, although Klug was later put out by Mathieu Bozzetto (FRA) in the quarter-finals when he crashed on his second run. Joining Bozzetto in the semi-finals were Benjamin Karl (AUT), Stanislav Detkov (RUS) and Canadian Jacey-Jay Anderson.
In the first of the semi finals, Karl won both his runs against Bozzetto fairly easily, his winning margin being 2.58 seconds. The second semi-final was much closer, with Anderson leading by 0.28 seconds after the first run. As Detkov tried to close the gap on the second run he fell halfway down the course, and eventually finished 1.72 seconds behind. This brought the final down to Karl against Andersson, the two pre-Games favorites. Anderson had won the 2009 World Championship and was second in the World Cup standings in 2009-10, trailing Karl, who had won the World Cup in 2007-08.
The contests for the medals were no less dramatic. In the bronze medal match, Bozzetto won the first run by 0.96 seconds from Detkov, both competitors making errors on the course. Unfortunately there was a problem with the sound at the starting gate for the second run, so the competitors didnât hear the normal bleeps. Detkov mistimed his start and crashed into the gates before they had opened, effectively ending the contest. In the final, Karl built up a reasonable lead after Anderson had made a number of minor errors to take a 0.76 second lead into the second run. However, despite the same problems with the start gate that had affected the bronze medal contest, Anderson timed his start to perfection and started to reel back Karl. With the finishing line in sight, Anderson finally overtook Karl and finished 0.35 seconds ahead to take the gold medal.
Questions were raised about the necessity for the 5th-8th place contests. In one of the classification semi-finals, Rok Flander (SLO) did not start, meaning his opponent Simon Schoch (SUI) simply went through the starting gate and promptly stopped twice, just to register the win. It was little different in the contest for 7th / 8th place when, with Flander not starting, Chris Klug went through the gate and promptly stopped after his first run. To the cheers of the crowd Klug went down the course on his second run in a solo display.

He was considered the American favorite in the Olympic pentathlon, but it was difficult to handicap the field as the event had never been contested internationally.
Thorpe solved the problem rather simply by winning four of the five events contested.  Only in the javelin throw was he beaten by any athlete, as both Sweden Hugo Wieslander and Oscar Lemming posted longer javelin throws.  Thorpe dominance was almost complete.  Using 1912 scoring tables, his margin of victory was over 400 points.
But as in the decathlon, Jim Thorpe only kept his pentathlon gold medal until early 1913 when he was disqualified for professionalism.  The gold medal reverted to Norway Ferdinand Bie.  For a complete description of the Thorpe controversy, see his bio on Olympedia.  Thorpe has also been awarded the Challenge Trophy for the pentathlon, which had been donated by the King of Sweden.
In 1982, after research by Bob Wheeler and Florence Ridlon, it was discovered that Thorpe medals should not have been removed, as any dispute as to eligibility had to have been made within 30 days after the end of the 1912 Olympics, but his medals were removed about 6 months later. The IOC restored Thorpe as the gold medalist but he was listed as the co-gold medalist with Ferdinand Bie in the pentathlon and with Hugo Wieslander in the decathlon.
Finally, in 2022, the IOC restored Thorpe as the sole gold medalist and would now list Bie and Wieslander as co-silver medalists. The official announcement from the IOC on 15 July 2022 was as follows: âOn 15 July 2022, on the day of the 110th anniversary of Thorpe medal in decathlon, the IOC announced its decision to display the name of Jim Thorpe as the sole gold medallist in pentathlon and decathlon at the Olympic Games Stockholm 1912. The IOC explained in its communication that this development was possible after the engagement of the Bright Path Strong organisation, supported by IOC Member Anita DeFrantz, who had contacted the Swedish Olympic Committee (SOC) and the surviving family members of Hugo K. Wieslander, who had been named as the gold medallist in decathlon when Thorpe was stripped of his medals in 1913. The family had confirmed that Wieslander himself had never accepted the Olympic gold medal allocated to him, and had always been of the opinion that Jim Thorpe was the sole legitimate Olympic gold medallist. The same declaration was received from the Norwegian Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Confederation of Sports, whose athlete, Ferdinand Bie, was named as the gold medallist when Thorpe was stripped of the pentathlon title.â

Previously points were scored for field sprints at various intervals of the race. But the winners could only be the riders staying on the same lap as the leaders. In 2004, the scoring was adjusted so that lapping any rider earned a 20-point bonus and this was added to the points for field sprints. This created the same effect but made it easier to sort out the leaders. The race was conducted over 40 km. (160 laps) with sprints every 10 laps. Young Russian Mikhail Ignatyev was unheralded but won the race by having a lap advantage on four other riders. Five stragglers in the race had been lapped four times by Ignatyev, but only three times by the chase group. Thus Ignatyev had 80 lap points, and 13 sprint points, or 93 in all.

The event was scheduled to start at 4:30 PM (1630) on Sunday afternoon, with no qualifying held on Saturday. The Americans claimed that the French told them that any field event final which was contested on Sunday would not be considered finished until the Americans had a chance on the next day to better the marks posted. This was apparently ruled at a meeting on Wednesday, 11 July. But on Saturday night, the French ruled that the results of all Sunday events would be final, with no recourse to any athletes who did not compete due to Sabbatarian objections. Apparently the Americans were not told of this decision.
The top American vaulters were Charles Dvorak, Daniel Horton, and Bascom Johnson. They were not at the field on Sunday when the pole vault started. Fortunately for the American team, Irv Baxter, who had just won the high jump (which started at 3:45 PM [1545]), and Meredith Colket, were present and were able to compete in the vault.  They took the first two places without much difficulty.
On Monday, Bascom Johnson, in a special event organized by the French authorities to assuage the angry American authorities, cleared 3.38 metres.  But it had no bearing on the Olympic championship. On Thursday, 19 July, the pole vault handicap was held and was won by Jakab Kauser of Hungary. But the Americans were still protesting the Sunday competition, so again a special pole vault competition, at scratch, was organized. In this event, Dan Horton cleared 3.45 metres, and Charles Dvorak was second with 3.35. It mattered little as the French never changed their ruling and the listing below is the accepted one.

In 1936, he would suffer a similar fate, placing fifth. Four vaulters went over 4.25 (13-111/4) â Meadows, Sefton, and two Japanese, the 1932 silver medalist, Shuhei Nishida, and Sueo Oe. But at 4.35 (14-31/4), only Meadows succeeded, clearing on his second attempt, and he had the gold medal.
Nishida, Oe, and Sefton went to a jump-off at 4.15 (13-71/4), with Sefton missing and out of the medals. It has been written more recently that the Japanese places were decided by lot or a coin toss, placing Nishida second and Oe third. However, it appears that after Sefton had been eliminated in the jump-off, the Japanese officials stepped in and chose Nishida to receive the silver medal and Oe the bronze. Several reasons are given in contemporary German sources â 1) Nishida was older, and 2) Nishida had cleared 4.25 on his first jump, while Oe failed once at that height. While there is some justification for listing both as equal second, we follow the 1936 Official Report which has Nishida second and Oe third. However, back in Japan, Nishida and Oe took their medals, cut them apart, and combined them into a half-silver, half-bronze medal, the only two of their type ever created.
The lack of countback rules resulted in an 11-way tie for sixth. One of those in =6th was Canadian Syl Apps, one of Canada greatest-ever athletes. He later played for 10 years with the Toronto Maple Leafs in the NHL and was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1961.

Gilbert had also won the Eastern Olympic Trial with Dray and Nelson tieing for second.  Among other nations, the top vaulters were Sweden Bruno SÃ¶derstrÃ¶m, 1907 AAA champion and silver medalist in 1906, and Canada Ed Archibald, who had cleared 12-5 (3.80) in Canada earlier in the season and three weeks before the Games had won the British title at 12-0 (3.66).
Five competitors broke the Olympic record, and two more equalled the former record.  The Americans, Alfred âA. C.â Gilbert and Ed Cook shared first place at 12-2 (3.71) with Archibald and SÃ¶derstrÃ¶m tieing with Charles Jacobs (USA) for third.  The closing stages of the competition were considerably delayed as they coincided with the dramatic happenings at the finish of the marathon.  Because of the time factor, the officials decided against holding jump-offs for first and third places and, in an unusual decision, two gold and three bronze medals were awarded.
For the last time in Olympic competition, the âclimbingâ technique was permitted although it remained legal in England until 1920.  Among their numerous protests, the Americans argued about the fact that there was no pit or hole in which to plant the pole and also that there was no sandpit or bales of straw to break the competitors falls.  This protest was understandable as the organizers were definitely behind the times in these matters as these facilities had been provided at the two previous Olympic Games.
Edward Cook was a fine all-around jumper and hurdler.  He won the IC4A long jump in 1908 and 1909, the AAU pole vault in 1907 and tied for first in the AAU pole vault in 1911.  Gilbert spread his athletic talents even farther, winning the 1905 Yale gymnastics championship and was intercollegiate wrestling champion in 1906.  Gilbert earned an M.D. degree from Yale but never practiced medicine.  He later made a fortune as president of the toy company that bore his name and manufactured Erector Sets, American Flyer electric trains, and other popular toys.

There were two series with the target in view for 8 seconds, two series with it in view for 6 seconds, and two series with it in view for 4 seconds. Scoring was first by number of targets hit, and then by score. The target was a silhouette figure of a man, 160 cm. in height and 45 cm. wide, with 10 scoring rings. The pistol or revolver had to be of .22 calibre. Most shooters used the Walther Olympia as in 1936, but the Italian Beretta was also popular. The top 22 shooters succeeded in hitting all targets so the competition came down to points scored. The event was won by KÃ¡roly TakÃ¡cs of Hungary, who scored 580 points. In second was Carlos Enrique DÃ­az of Argentina, who was the reigning world champion and used a Colt Woodsman pistol, equipped with a compensator to reduce recoil and muzzle flip. TakÃ¡cs had been a top shooter before the War, and was a member of the Hungarian team that won the world team title at Luzern in 1939. He was on the national team from 1929 thru 1938 as a right-handed shooter. But in September 1938, during Army maneuvers, a grenade blew off his right hand.

France was the favorite, having won gold at the past three mixed relay world championships, but Great Britain, the USA, and Germany were also rated highly. Of the original 18 entered teams only 16 actually competed with South Africa withdrawing as Henri Schoeman had broken an ankle while running the individual race. Austria resigned shortly before the start due to an Achillesâ tendon injury to Lisa Perterer. The Tokyo individual champions Kristian Blummenfelt and Flora Duffy could not compete, as their nations did not qualify enough triathletes. The weather was fine in the early morning, but again very warm with air and water temperatures of 28 degrees each.
As expected, all of the top nations had their best female swimmers in the first starting position. Britain Jess Learmonth came out of the water first, but the field was close together. A top quartet formed on the bike, opening a gap of just under 30 seconds on the pursuers. Learmonth finished the run in first place, while the German Laura Lindemann handed over to Jonas Schomburg in second place who passed Britain Jonathan Brownlee in the transition area and was the first to dive into water.
The German swam in the lead, with Brownlee, American Kevin McDowell and Dutchman Marco van der Stel in tow. The four then went on the bike course together, while the first chasing group with France, Belgium, and Italy was still half a minute behind. Brownlee then picked up the pace in the run and quickly dropped his three associates and handed over the baton to Georgia Taylor-Brown as sole leader. Behind the top group the Frenchman Dorian Coninx was almost able to close up with a strong run and Belgium, with Marten Van Riel, was only a few seconds behind.
Taylor-Brown extended the lead in swimming ahead of the American Taylor Knibb. A group formed behind them in the battle for third place after the Frenchwoman Cassandre Beaugrand was able to completely close the small gap in swimming and advanced to second place. Taylor-Brown dominated cycling as the leader and finished the section with a gap of 11 seconds. At the last change, Taylor-Brown handed over to Alex Yee, who was 21 seconds ahead of the USA, and with France and Vincent Luis 33 seconds behind in third.
The preliminary decision about the medallists had now been made, and only the order of the medals remained uncertain. Luis tried everything to bring the victory to France. He closed the gap to the American Morgan Pearson and even distanced him near the end of the swim. He chased Britain but Yee was too strong. Leading on the run, Alex Yee brought the gold medal home for Great Britain, while behind him Luis had to pay for his attacks, as Pearson caught up with him again on the first running lap and secured the silver medal for the United States.

The event had not originally been intended for Windsor, but was to be held at Richmond Park in Surrey.  However, a law was discovered that prohibited any activity there at more than 20 miles per hour, so the event had to be moved to Windsor. The race started in a torrential downpour, which limited the spectators who braved the weather. The biggest problem with the course was the loose gravel roads, which caused over 100 punctures in all.
It was difficult to pick a favorite as international racing had been stalled by the war. The 1947 World Championships had been won by Italy Adolfo Ferrari, who raced at Windsor, but trailed in only in 9th place, the leader of the chasing group. On the second lap of the race, three riders, Nils Johansson, Gerrit Voorting, and Henk Faanhof, dropped the peleton. Johansson punctured on the 9th lap and was caught by the pack. On the 12th lap, a group of nine riders caught the leading pair. Two punctures and a crash left a group of eight leading riders to contest the final lap. On the last lap, shortly before the top of Breakheart Hill, a short climb of no more than 25 metres elevation, JosÃ© Beyaerts broke away and opened up a gap of eight bike lengths with less than 800 metres remaining.

He would later become one of the greatest professional cyclists ever, winning the Tour de France in 1986, 1989-90. The favorite in LeMond absence was Sergey Sukhoruchenkov (USSR), who had dominated the 1979 season and won the Peace Race, known as the âTour de France of Eastern Europe.â The home rider did not disappoint. He first rode away on the third lap, but was joined by a group of riders two laps later. The leading pack included two former World Champions, Swiss Gilbert Glaus (1978) and Italian Gianni Giacomini (1979). Sukhoruchenkov broke away again with 32 km. remaining and won by almost three minutes, with fourth place 7:44 in arrears, the largest margin of victory since the event had become a mass start race in 1936.

The race was held in hot and humid conditions. Prior to the Beijing Olympics, many endurance athletes had complained about the air pollution in Beijing but, on the day of the road race, it was relatively clear for the Chinese capital city. The first major break occurred at 60 km., with 26 riders going away. They were in front for almost 125 km. The peleton caught them with 60 km. remaining in the race, but by then two riders, Aleksandr Kuchinsky (BLR) and Ruslan Pidhorniy (UKR), had broken away.

SÃ¡nchez and Rebellin were the most aggressive riders in the break, until Cancellara tried to go off the front, but he was quickly pulled back. Cancellara was not known as a sprinter, but was a great time trialist, and he often used this strength to get away before the sprint. The final sprint was close with all six finishing within a bike length, but SÃ¡nchez was the fastest off the top of the Badaling climb, and edged our Rebellin for the gold medal, with Cancellara taking bronze, or so it seemed.
In November 2009, however, Davide Rebellin, the original silver medalist, was disqualified when his sample from Beijing tested positive for CERA (continuous erythropoietin receptor activator), which stimulates erythropoietin (EPO) production and increases hemoglobin levels for better oxygen usage. Switzerland Fabian Cancellara, who won the individual time trial gold medal in Beijing, was moved up to the silver medal position and Russian Aleksandr Kolobnev was awarded the bronze medal.

By now, American riders were becoming more prominent internationally and the home course advantage and absent Eastern European riders led many to pick American riders as favorites. Davis Phinney was highly considered, as the best sprinter on the US team, but the course was a hilly one of 12 laps over 190.2 km., and Phinney, not a great climber, missed the winning break, eventually finishing fifth. American Alexi Grewal and Canadian Steve Bauer broke away on the penultimate lap.  Though they never had a large lead on the trailing Norwegian twosome of Dag Otto Lauritzen and Morten Saether, Grewal and Bauer were able to stay away to the finish. Bauer was considered the better sprinter but Grewal pipped him in the sprint by less than a wheel. Bauer later had a solid professional career, finishing fourth at the 1988 Tour de France, and wearing the yellow jersey in both 1988 and 1990. One rider who did not finish was Miguel IndurÃ¡in, who from 1991-95 became the first cyclist to win the Tour de France in five consecutive years.
Grewal also turned professional but his career was less impressive. He won a few domestic races but never won in Europe in a major international race. Grewal mere participation in 1984 was controversial. He had tested positive only 10 days before the Olympics, after the Coors Classic in Colorado, for phenylethylamine, a stimulant. He was suspended for 30 days by the US Cycling Federation and dropped from the Olympic team. But Grewal appealed the suspension, noting that he took albuterol for asthma and the tests were not sophisticated enough to tell the difference between the two drugs.  Reinstated, he was able to race at Los Angeles.

However, the course was not really difficult enough to break apart the peleton.  In addition, it was held in a heavy rain, which slowed the pace somewhat.
The Amateur Road Race World Championships had been won in 1961 by Jean Jourden (FRA), in 1962-63 by Italy Renato Bongioni and Flaviano Vicentini, respectively.  But none of these three entered the Olympic Road Race, both Italians having turned pro.  Earlier in 1964, the 1964 World Championship was won by the young Belgian rider, Eddy Merckx.
The relatively easy course kept the pack mostly together throughout the race. Of the 132 starters, 107 finished, and the first 99 riders crossed the finishing line together.  A few break-outs occurred, but the last of those ended 15 km from the finish, Merckx tried to get away with 1.5 km to go, but only managed a gap of some 20 m before getting caught by the pack. The two leaders of the sprint-out were Italy Mario Zanin and Denmark Kjell Rodian, with Zanin narrowly edging Rodian to win the gold medal.
Eddy Merckx was right there at the finish but the great Belgian rider was not a strong enough sprinter to win the race, and he finished 12th.  His time would come.  Merckx turned professional in April 1965 and became the greatest rider in the professional peleton, and is usually considered the greatest cyclist of all-time.  He was later nicknamed âThe Cannibalâ for his aggressive riding style and never-ending hunger for victories, which helped him win 5 Tours de France, 5 Giros dâItalia, 3 World Professional Road titles, and multiple wins in the one-day classics.
The results of the 1964 road race are somewhat in dispute.  The 1964 Official Report and 1964 Official Results both list âallâ finishers, but they only agree in the first 35 places.  In fact, the Report only lists 86 finishers while the Results lists 107 finishers.  We have consulted multiple sources to try to make sense of this problem, including contacting national federations and some of the riders involved in the race.  We believe that the following results are an accurate representation of the finishers, but recognize that this problem may not be fully resolved.

The course had been used for the 1974 World Championships and the favorite was probably Ryszard Szurkowski of Poland, who was 1973 World Champion and had placed second on the course in 1974. The 1974 champion was his teammate, Janusz Kowalski, but he did not compete in MontrÃ©al. On the sixth lap, a group of 10 riders got away, and formed the winning group. On the last lap, Bernt Johansson was able to successfully break away and won the gold medal by 31 seconds. The winner of the sprint for the silver was Peter Thaler, but he was relegated to ninth place for interfering with other riders in the sprint and failing to keep his line. The final sprint included an American, George Mount, unusual for that era, who finished sixth. Szurkowski had missed the winning break and finished 12th, among the leaders of the trailing sprint. Of the three medalists, only Johansson would have a notable pro career. His best performance came in the 1979 Giro dâItalia, in which he placed third and won two stages.

(137.85 miles) mass start race.,na,"For the first time at the Olympics, all the top professional riders were allowed to compete. This caused some changes to the road race especially.  The race was longer, at 221.85 km., more in keeping with the length of professional classics. And each nation was allowed to have five riders, rather than the standard three, to allow the nationsâ teams to work together more, similar to the professional peleton. It was difficult to choose a favorite for the race. Spain Miguel IndurÃ¡in, who had won the Tour de France was in the race, his first Olympic appearance since 1984. But he had lost the 1996 Tour de France, and was not a great sprinter or classics rider. The race came down to a three-man break, consisting of Pascal Richard (FRA), Rolf SÃ¸rensen (DEN), and Max Sciandri (GBR), who got away with 33 km. remaining. Richard won the sprint for the gold medal. The Americans had hoped for a medal on their home course, but had to settle for fourth place, as Frankie Andreu won a three-rider sprint for the 4th-6th places.
There were 183 riders from 57 nations in the race, but one more country had also attempted to enter the event. Eritrea had gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993, but was not yet recognized by the IOC, failing to meet the minimum requirement of five national sports federations. They had only a cycling federation, which sent Yonas Zekerias and Bekeret Zere to Atlanta apparently in ignorance of the IOC decision. But they were not allowed to compete.

308000,"Road Race, Individual, Men",2012 Summer Olympics,54,Cycling Road,28 July 2012,"The Mall, London",144 from 63 countries,na,Distance: 249.5 km,"The winner of the men road race at the 2008 Summer Olympics, Spain Samuel SÃ¡nchez, was injured during the 2012 Tour de France and bowed out of defending his title in London. This left silver medalist Fabian Cancellara of Switzerland, who had also won the individual time trial in Beijing, as a significant favorite going into the event, although many observers also placed their bets on local hero Mark Cavendish, who was to be supported by a British )dream team) that included multiple Olympic gold medalist Bradley Wiggins, who just days before had won the Tour de France. The course flat terrain was thought to be the ideal setting for strong sprinters such as Cavendish to capture the podium.
A strong overall British team led the pack for much of the race, but slowly its members began to drop off from the competition. They were further set back when they decided against joining a critical breakaway 40km from the finish, hoping instead to stay with the peloton and have Cavendish sprint to gold in the final stretch of the race. With approximately 15km left to go, Cancellara crashed on a turn, opening up the competition to some of the second favorites such as Germany Andre Greipel and Belgium Tom Boonen. With approximately 10km to go, however, Columbia Rigoberto UrÃ¡n and Kazakhstan Aleksandr Vinokurov broke away from the pack and led it for the remainder of the race. The duo was neck and neck until the end, when UrÃ¡n slowed to look behind and Vinokurov bolted forwards for an easy victory. When the remainder of the pack caught up, it was Norway Alexander Kristoff who claimed the bronze.
Vinokurov was a dark horse for the victory. Although he had been cycling in the Olympics since 1996, and won silver in the individual road race in 2000 (having supposedly given up his shot at a victory to help his former professional teammate Jan Ullrich take gold that year), he was banned from the sport for two years in 2007 after testing positive for blood doping. He announced his retirement later that year, but returned in 2009 and continued to ride until 2011, when a fall during the Tour de France led him to proclaim retirement once more. After better than anticipated results with rehabilitation, however, he returned to cycling for the 2012 season, hoping to make the 2012 Olympic road race his last major competition. His victory, at nearly 39 years old, made him the oldest Olympic road racing champion, besting a record set by Jeannie Longo-Ciprelli of France in 1996. UrÃ¡n medal, meanwhile, was the first for Columbia in the Olympic road race and Kristoff was Norway first since Dag Otto Lauritzen in 1984.

The 1971 World Champion, RÃ©gis Ovion was also present in MÃ¼nchen. The course was a relatively easy and flat one. A group of some 35 riders got away on the sixth lap. Over the last lap, the Dutchman Hennie Kuiper was able to go off the front of the breakaway and eventually won by 27 seconds. The third-placed rider was Jaime HuÃ©lamo, but he was disqualified after a positive doping test for Coramine, a stimulant. Because fourth-place finisher Bruce Biddle was not tested for drugs, no bronze medal was awarded. Maertens finished 13th and Ovion 15th. The race was marred by the presence of four cyclists from the Irish Republican Army, who jumped into the field to protest the Irish riders competing against cyclists from Northern Ireland (who competed for Great Britain). They were arrested but were later released.
Hennie Kuiper had an excellent, and very long, career as a pro, winning the World Championships (1975), Paris-Roubaix (1983), the Giro di Lombardia (1981), Milan-San Remo (1985), the Tour de Suisse (1976), and the Ronde de Vlaanderen (1981), as well as twice finishing second at the Tour de France (1977, 1980).

On the next-to-last lap, a three-rider break formed and Dekker was in it, while Armstrong was too closely marked and did not catch it.  With Dekker were the Latvian, Dainis Ozols and the Italian, Fabio Casartelli. They stayed away and Casartelli held off Dekker in the sprint to win the gold medal.  All the leading riders later turned professional.  Armstrong had one of the greatest cycling careers ever, winning seven consecutive Tours de France (1999-2005).  Dekker became a solid professional rider in the peleton, winning four stages at the Tour de France and the 2001 Amstel Gold Race.  Ozols rode professionally from 1995-2000, winning a stage in the 1996 Peace Race.
Fabio Casartelli eventually became a domestique on the Motorola team and supported Armstrong in the 1995 Tour de France.  On the 15th stage of that race, he went off a curve in the Pyrenees, while descending the Col de Portet dâAspet, and hit his un-helmeted head on a concrete pylon.  Doctors were quickly on the scene but he died almost instantly. The next day, the peleton allowed Motorola teammate Armstrong to ride away uncontested to victory, in Casartelli memory.  As Armstrong crossed the finish line, he raised both hands to the sky, and looked up, remembering and honoring his fallen teammate.

The riders started in Athens on the Odos Kifisia, rode to Marathon, and then returned to Athens, finishing at the velodrome at Neo Phaliron. In Marathon they were required to sign a document in the presence of an official, verifying that they had arrived there.
The pack rode together most of the way to Marathon. On the return, the pack split due to many falls.  Aristidis Konstantinidis fell three times, Anton GÃ¶drich also fell and had to stop to borrow a new bike because of damage to his original. Konstantinidis flatted near Athens and was overtaken by Edward Battel. Konstantinidis borrowed a bicycle and continued but crashed just as he caught up to Battel. He borrowed yet another bike and caught Battel, who was exhausted from the effort of staying ahead of Konstantinidis and ended up barely finishing.
Battel was a servant at the British Embassy in Athens.  Some British officials attempted to prevent him from entering the Olympic cycling events on the grounds that his job disqualified him as a gentleman, and thus he could not be an amateur.

But neither was considered a great sprinter. With 25 km. to do, the peleton made a grave tactical error when it allowed three riders from the same professional team, Deutsche Telekom (later T-Mobile), to get away together. The riders were Kazakhstan Aleksandr Vinokurov, and the Germans Andreas KlÃ¶den and Ullrich. Vinokurov and KlÃ¶den served as domestiques on the Deutsche Telekom team, supporting and riding for Ullrich and the finish, with Ullrich winning the sprint comfortably for the gold medal, was a foregone conclusion.

But as the summer wore on, his form went off a little. Rather than riding in the hilly country outside of Athens, the race was contested in the city, and the relatively flat course was not difficult enough to break apart the professional peleton. Into the last lap, 40 riders remained together, but a foursome of Paolo Bettini (ITA), SÃ©rgio Paulinho (POR), Axel Merckx (BEL), and Erik Zabel (GER) got away together. On reputation, Zabel was the most highly considered, especially as a sprinter, but Bettini and Paulinho got away to win gold and silver. Merckx, the son of Eddy Merckx, chased their break, but did not catch it, but managed to stay away to win the bronze, with Zabel winning the field sprint. Bettini was a solid professional rider. He had won several classics from 2000-2004, and a stage in the Tour de France in 2000, and he would win the World Championships road race in 2006-07.
Four riders, 3 Americans and a Canadian, were retrospectively disqualified from the race following the investigation into the US Postal team doping scandal.

The other favorites were Frank Southall, who had finished second to Hansen in 1928, and Italy Giuseppe Olmo.  Olmo did not win, finishing fourth, but the Italians dominated the race, placing 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 7th, led by Attilio Pavesi, who won the gold medal, and runner-up Guglielmo Segato. Pavesi was the 35th and last rider to start but passed six cyclists en route to his gold medal. Segato had been the 27th starter and had been on the same pace as Pavesi until he crashed only a few kilometers from the finish on the Saticoy curve.  This was the last time that the Olympic road race was conducted as a time trial, although the time trial returned to the Olympics in 1996 as a separate event. Pavesi turned pro after the Olympics, but never made a big impression, ending up riding six-day events in Argentina.

The riders were sent off at two minute intervals, with the last scheduled rider starting at 7 AM (0700).  Of the 151 entrants only 123 riders eventually started.  The individual event was won by Rudolph âOkeyâ Lewis of South Africa.  He started quickly and led by 111/2 minutes at 120 km.  Increasing the lead to 17 minutes at 200 km., he slowed slightly coming in, but still won by almost nine minutes over Freddie Grubb of Great Britain.  As the second starter, going off at 2:02 AM, he was the first overall finisher as well.  Little is known about Lewisâ cycling career, even by South African experts.  It was noted that the weather at the start time of 2 AM was cool, with no wind, which favored the very early starters.  By 7 AM a strong westerly wind was blowing directly into the faces of the later starting riders.  As the second starter, Lewis definitely benefited from his start position.
The previous record for the MÃ¤laren Rundt was 11-22:07.0, set in 1909 by Henrik MorÃ©n of Sweden, a 10-time winner of the race, including nine consecutive wins from 1902-1910.

No less than 16 riders, including MorÃ©n himself, in 15th place, bettered the previous record.
In addition to the Olympic medals, a Diploma of Merit was given to cyclists who finished within 25% of the winner time.  As Lewis finished in 10-42:39, all riders under 13-23:18.8 qualified, and thus 81 of the 94 riders who finished received this special diploma.

The defending Olympic champion Greg Van Avermaet of Belgium was hoping to become the first man to successfully defend his title. South America best chance was with Ecuador Richard Carapaz, who came to the Games having finished third in the Tour de France, while Spain Alejandro Valverde could never be discounted. Great Britain had a strong team, with three Grand Tour winners in their squad. They had the 2018 Tour de France winner Geraint Thomas, that year Vuelta a EspaÃ±a winner Simon Yates, and the 2020 Giro dâItalia winner Tao Geoghegan Hart.
Two of the British riders, Hart and Thomas, were involved in a crash in the early part of the race that left them trailing at the back of the field, before they both eventually pulled out of the race. For the 35-year-old Thomas it was the third major race in succession in which he was involved in a collision, following ones at the Giro dâItalia, and the Tour de France just three weeks before the Olympics.
Raced in warm and very humid conditions, a five-man group broke away and built up a 20-minute lead but, on the severe climb up Mount Fuji, that lead was gradually reduced. The climb was too much for the 41-year-old Spaniard Valverde, and the 2018 world champion quit the race. With 48km to go, the breakaway group was pulled back and joined the peloton, before three men, including the Italian Vincenzo Nibali, formed another breakaway. With a little more than an hour to go, however, the two-time Tour de France winner PogaÄar took the lead, but a group of riders went with him, including the Belgian Wout van Aert, to prevent the Slovenian building up a big lead. Canada Mike Woods and Britain Adam Yates joined the leaders before Carapaz and Brandon McNulty (USA) pulled clear and built up a 20-second lead, which they extended thanks to working together and, with so many riders tiring, it looked like Carapaz and McNulty would fight for gold and silver.
Going into the final 7 km, however, their lead was down to less than 20 seconds and, at around 6 km, Carapaz made a solo break from the tiring McNulty, who was rapidly overtaken by the chasing group. Carapaz raced away around the Fuji Speedway, where James Hunt clinched the 1976 World Formula One title, to win by 1:07, and become only the second Olympic gold medallist from Ecuador after Jefferson PÃ©rez in the 20 km walk in 1996. It was then down to eight men to fight it out for the two other medal places and it was Britain Adam Yates who made the break for the line but, after a frantic sprint, it was the Belgian van Aert and PogaÄar who took bronze and silver respectively. A photo-finish revealed that Van Aert took silver by the width of a tyre. Because of the intense heat and humidity, only 85 of the 128 starters finished the race.

At least one cyclist, Korean No Do-Cheon, succumbed to the heat and had to be carried off to the hospital. The Danish team did not start the race after the death of their compatriot Knud Enemark Jensen in the team time trial.
East Germany Gustav-Adolf Schur had won the Amateur Road Race World Championship in both 1958 and 1959, the first rider ever to defend that title.  In 1960, the title went to his teammate, Bernhard Eckstein.  Both riders competed in Rome and Schur had to be favored, but he was marked closely and never figured in any breakaways.  The race began at 0900.  On the second lap, the Netherlandsâ Lex van Kreuningen, broke away and opened up 46 seconds on the peloton by the fourth lap.  On lap five, he was joined by his teammate Jan Hugens, and they led together thru lap six.  On the next lap, seven other riders caught the Dutch tandem, to make a lead group of nine.  This group included Italy Livio TrapÃ¨, and the Soviet Union Viktor Kapitonov.  Over the next two laps a few other riders joined the leaders, but on lap 10, TrapÃ¨ and Kapitonov went off the front together, and had 52 seconds on the peleton at the end of that circuit.  As the two neared the end of lap 11, Kapitonov took off and started a mad sprint, thinking the race was ending.  But they had one more lap to go, and the two entered it with a lead of 2:29.  At the finish, Kapitonov had enough left to repeat his sprint and narrowly defeat TrapÃ¨. This greatly disappointed the Italian crowd, who had hoped for an Italian win, which would have completed a sweep of the cycling events. A pack of 39 riders closed on the two leaders in the last lap, but finished 20 seconds down.  This group included Schur and Eckstein, and the entire German team was placed consecutively from 20-23 place.
The 1960 cycling road race has been a difficult event to document statistically as the Official Report lists only the 76 finishing riders. It mentions that there were 142 riders from 42 nations, but the other 66 riders are not listed directly.  There are some lap results that help identify the non-finishers.  We have been able to identify what we believe is the correct list of non-finishers by using various sources.  We have contacted numerous national cycling federations, asking for their information on their national riders.  In a few cases, we contacted some of the supposed competitors directly.  We finally found a copy of the Official Program from the day of the race, which listed the starters, and was accompanied by a list entitled âEntry Modifications,â which noted when some riders did not start and some were replaced by other riders on their teams.  We believe the results listed below are the best representation of who actually started on 30 August 1960. However, there are also problems with who actually finished the race in certain positions, based on personal reports from the riders, and photographs of the finish. We have footnoted these as necessary, but these results do not quite follow the results in the Official Report precisely.
Part of the problem may arise from the actions of the treasurer of the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), Albert Verougstraete, who was the judge at the finish line who was responsible for determining the final placements. But the Belgian judge listed the top 10 finishers and then left to have lunch, stating, âIâm hungry. Iâll issue a full list sometime tonight.â

Alberto Contador of Spain did not compete and Nairo Quintana of Colombia, who finished third in the Tour de France shortly before the Olympics, opted out of Rio to concentrate on the Vuelta after the Games. Spain best chance of gold came from Alejandro Valverde, bronze medallist at the 2012, 2013 and 2014 World Championships and four Grand Tour podiums in the last three years.
There were no changes in the format since London 2012, with the 144 starters setting off in a mass start from Flamengo Park and, after travelling 37.4 km along Avenida AtlÃ¢ntica, adjacent to the Atlantic Ocean and Copacabana Beach, they then completed four laps of the 24.7 km Grumari circuit, which was used for the time trials, and had two challenging climbs: the Grota Funda and the Grumari climb. After leaving Grumari, the competitors engaged in a 26.4 km ride to the 25.7 km Vista Chinesa circuit, with its two climbs, Canoas and Vista Chinesa, and its 6 km descent, of which they completed two laps followed by a third loop of 20.2 km, and then the 3.3 km ride back to Flamengo Park. The total distance was 237.5 km.
The fans were treated to high drama and none more than in the closing stages. After just 15 km, however, came the first attack by six riders and they gradually increased their lead to over seven minutes. They stayed together at the front, falling apart around 160 km, but one of the leaders, MichaÅ Kwiatkowski of Poland, the 2014 World Champion, actually stayed in the lead, either on his own, or part of a group, until the 197 km mark â a total of 185 km in the lead. He was dropped from the leading group at that point but got back into it and he was still one of the 11-man breakaway group at 207 km, which also included Sergio Luis Henao of Colombia and the British pair of Adam Yates, winner of the Young Rider classification in the 2016 Tour de France and Geraint Thomas, who sportingly stopped and waited while Chris Froome changed his bike at 142 km. Henao was a member of the Sky team that helped Froome win his third Tour de France in 2016.
With just 16.5 km to go, Sergio Luis Henao, 2016 Giro winner Nibali and RafaÅ Majka of Poland were the three front runners and seemed to have the medal positions wrapped up between them, but just four kilometres later, Henao and Nibali crashed heavily on the Vista Chinesa descent, which is where Geraint Thomas and Australia Richie Porte races also ended. This accident allowed the 2016 Tour de France King of the Mountains winner Majka to build up a 20-second lead that he soon extended to 24 seconds. With seven men in the chasing pack, however, he was caught with 1400 metres to go as Belgium Greg Van Avermaet crossed the line first in 6hr 10min 5sec and enjoyed the biggest win of his career, bettering his 2015 and 2016 stage wins in the Tour de France. Van Avermaet father Ronald also competed in the road race, at the 1980 Moscow Olympics. This was only Belgium second ever gold in the men road race, following AndrÃ© Noyelle win in 1952. Majka held on for the bronze with Jakob Fuglsang winning the silver medal with the same time as Van Avermaet.

The race started and at 8 AM at the North Curve of the Avus motor racing circuit, with the finish line drawn there as well.  The course was an out-and-back one over relatively flat roads, and it was not difficult enough to break apart most of the peleton. There were a number of crashes during the race. Many riders used the innovative three-speed bikes, but several of the Peruvian riders had trouble controlling their bikes with these and caused at least one major crash. Some 40 riders sprinted for victory in the final metres, with France Robert Charpentier defeating his countryman Guy LapÃ©bie by a bike length. They led the French team to an easy victory in the team road race. Behind them, the German officials had trouble placing the remaining cyclists, and a large group of cyclists was placed in 16th position. There was another large crash only a few yards from the finish line, which took down about 20 riders, several of whom could not finish.
Charpentier had been runner-up at the 1935 World Championships.  He turned professional but with little success, and his career was interrupted by World War II. LapÃ©bie fared better as a pro, finishing third in the 1948 Tour de France, and competing thru 1952. His older brother, Roger LapÃ©bie, was a well-known pro, and won the 1937 Tour de France.
The 1936 Official Report does not list any riders as did not finish, but it appears several of the riders did not complete the course. We have been able to find information on some of these from other sources, but it is possible that some of the riders we list as having finished did not actually complete the course.

But the dead flat course did not allow her or any rider to break open the field, and it came down to a field sprint. Finishing in Sydney downpour, the winner was the Dutch rider Leontien Zijlaard-Van Moorsel over Germany Hanka Kupfernagel. Zijlaard-Van Moorsel performance at the 2000 Olympics rivals any in cycling history. She won the road race, the individual time trial, the 3,000 metre individual pursuit on the track, and won a silver medal in the points race on the track. She won the World Championships on the roads in 1991 and 1993, and in the Time Trial in 1998-99, and was a four-time individual pursuit World Champion (1990, 2001-03). Her career occurred in two phases. After 1993, she suffered from anorexia nervosa and lost almost 20 kg. (44 lbs.). But she recovered and returned to international cycling in the late 90s to enjoy her greatest successes.

The women no longer raced a Tour de France Feminin and several other top female races were dropped because of lack of sponsorship. Thus the Olympics and World Championships assumed even greater importance to the female professional riders. For the first time ever at the Olympics, there was no clear favorite in 2004, partly because there were fewer international races. The once dominant Jeannie Longo, rode in her sixth Olympics in 2004, but had not won any major titles in years. The defending champion, Leontien Zijlaard-Van Moorsel of the Netherlands, was back, but nobody could expect her to repeat her 2000 Olympic performance in which she won three events (road race, time trial, individual pursuit) and was silver medalist in the points race. A fall early in the race eliminated her from the competition. Based on earlier results, Sweden Susanne Ljungskog , the 2002 and 2003 World Champion was also favored for a medal, but she was dropped early and finished 33rd. The race was run thru the center of Athens, but unlike the men race, several groups did break away. On the final lap, the two leaders were Australia Sara Carrigan and Germany Judith Arndt. But it did not really come down to a sprint, as Carrigan broke Arndt over the last kilometer and won by seven seconds. It was somewhat of an upset as this was Carrigan first major international victory. Arndt was better known, having won a bronze medal in the pursuit at the 1996 Olympics, a World Championship in the pursuit in 1997, and she would win the 2004 World Championship road race.

Also highly considered were two Americans, Connie Carpenter-Phinney and Rebecca Twigg. Twigg was also known for her brains and her looks. She had gone to college when only 14 years-old, skipping four years of high school, and also did some modeling. She had also won a silver medal at the 1983 World Championships, behind Marianne Berglund  of Sweden. Carpenter-Phinney had competed as a speed skater at the 1972 Winter Olympics, and was married to American cyclist Davis Phinney, who also competed at the 1984 Olympic Games and was known as a great sprinter. The final breakaway in the race came midway thru, and included Longo, Carpenter-Phinney, and Twigg, as well as top Italian rider, Maria Canins. Twigg, known for her sprinting ability on the track, was favored to win the sprint. Less than a kilometer from the finish, Longo and Canins hit their wheels, and Longo chain came off, eliminating her. Twigg led out the sprint and appeared to have the race in hand, but Carpenter-Phinney caught her and used a bike-throwing technique she had learned from her husband to win by inches.

Several crashes occurred on the slick course, and several of these were blamed on poor marking of the course which confused the riders. On the final lap, a five-rider break went off the front, led by Italy Tatiana Guderzo, with only one favorite in the group â Nicole Cooke of Great Britain. Guderzo had placed second at the 2004 World Championships road race, but Cooke was considered much stronger, having been on the podium at the Worlds in both 2005 and 2006. Coming to the finish up the Badaling section of the Great Wall climb, Cooke and Guderzo were joined by Sweden Emma Johansson, as they dropped Christiane Soeder (AUT) and Linda Serup (DEN). Over the top of the climb, Cooke took the lead and held on to win by a bike length.

However, at 37, the French cycling federation considered her too old and stopped funding her, but they selected her for the Games anyway. On the eighth lap of the race, Longo got away with Italy Imelda Chiappa and Clara Hughes (CAN) and Anna Wilson (AUS). In the pouring rain, Wilson was dropped quickly, but the other three stayed away. Early on the final lap, Longo powered away from Chiappa and Hughes and rode to her much deserved gold medal. Hughes returned to the Olympics in 2000 in cycling and in 2002 and 2006, competed at the Winter Olympics in speed skating.

Britain Lizzie Armitstead, however, the silver medallist in 2012 and reigning world champion, was one of the fancied riders despite some people feeling she should have been banned after missing three OOC doping tests between August 2015 and June 2016. She was cleared to compete in the Olympics, however, by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Furthermore, Armitstead had 16 âcleanâ tests in 2016. Other potential medallists were London 2012 bronze medallist Olga Zabelinskaya, and 2015 World Championship silver and bronze medallists Anna van der Breggen, Netherlands, and Megan Guarnier, USA.
There were no changes in the format since London 2012, with the 68 starters setting off in a mass start from Flamengo Park and, after travelling 37.4 km along Avenida AtlÃ¢ntica, completing two laps of the 24.7 km Grumari circuit, which was used for the time trials, before a 26.4 km ride to the Vista Chinesa circuit where they completed a 20.4 km loop followed by the 3.3 km ride back to Flamengo Park - the total distance being 136.9 km.
First to attack at 21 km was the youngest rider in the race, 20-year-old Lotte Kopecky of Belgium, and five kilometres later she had a lead of over two minutes. She kept extending her lead with Romy Kasper of Germany making a move out of the peloton to chase Kopecky, but the German was soon back with the pack. At 48 km it was then up to Ellen van Dijk (Netherlands), Giorgia Bronzini (Italy) and Anna Plichta (Poland) to chase Kopecky, and her lead at 62 km was below a minute for the first time in the last 39 km. Shortly afterwards she was back with the group before Audrey Cordon of France was next to attack at 81 km but her lead did not last long and all the riders were together again at 89 km. Seven riders then made a break and in the group was the defending champion Marianne Vos. That leading pack was soon down to four riders: van der Breggen, Annemiek van Vleuten, Mara Abbott (USA) and Elisa Longo Borghini of Italy, the daughter of the Olympic cross country skier Guidina Dal Sasso. Van Vleuten then made a break with 18 km to go but was joined by Abbott with Emma Johansson joining the chasing pack of three riders some 50 seconds behind. With 15 km to go it started raining and van Vleuten was in the lead on her own but on the fast descent on the Vista Chinesa circuit back to the start, just as in the men race the day before, when the outright leaders crashed, van Vleuten had a bad crash. This left Abbott the lone leader 40 seconds ahead of the three chasers van der Breggen, Longo Borghini and Johansson but, agonizingly for the American, she was caught metres from the line with van der Breggen crossing the line first to make it successive women Olympic road race titles for the Netherlands, after Marianne Vos in 2012. For Abbott, she missed out on a medal as both Johansson and Longo Borghini overtook her for silver and bronze respectively. For Johansson, it was her second silver to add to the one she won in Beijing. Before turning professional in 2012, the Dutch champion, and 2015 and 2016 FlÃ¨che Wallonne winner, van der Breggen trained as a nurse, and completed an internship in Ghana.

However, Knol and Van Moorsel had a personal feud and refused to work for each other during the race. Near the end of the race, Longo rode with a group of 33 riders when she broke away three kilometers from the finish.  She stayed away and at first thought she had finally won her gold medal.  But due to poor information from the course directors, most of the pack had missed the fact that Australian Kathy Watt had pulled away from the field at the beginning of the final lap. Watt made this break while the pack was catching an earlier break, and it was not noticed. Watt opened up a big lead quickly and stayed away for the entire final circuit to win the gold medal. Watt was a top rider, having won the 1990 Commonwealth Games gold medal, and finishing third that year at the female Giro dâItalia.

It was 107 km shorter than the men race.
In both the women road race and time trial, it was difficult to see anybody toppling the strong Netherlands pair of Anna van der Breggen and Annemiek van Vleuten, the world No. 1 and 2 female road racers. Van der Breggen was the defending champion and was hoping to become the first women two-time road race champion. She also won the Giro dâItalia Femminile four times between 2015-21. The three World Road Race Championships between 2018-20 had been won by either van Breggen (twice) or van Vleuten (one). Van Vleuten had also won the Giro dâItalia Femminile twice, and between 2015-21 the pair had won four of the six races.
The Netherlands also had two other possible medal contenders at Tokyo in Marianne Vos and Demi Vollering, while the best of the other riders included Italy Elisa Longo Borghini (the daughter of Italian cross-country skier Guidina Dal Sasso), and Denmark Cecilie Uttrup Ludwig, bronze medallist at Rio, and 2020 World Championship bronze medal winner.
With barely 2km raced, five riders unusually made a break. With 40 km gone, the breakaway became four and was made up of Carla Oberholzer (South Africa), Anna Kiesenhofer (Austria), Omer Shapira (Israel), and Anna Plichta (Poland) and, with 70 km to go, was reduced to three with Carla Oberholzer dropping back and, all of a sudden, the three leaders had more than a 10-minute lead on the peloton. Remarkably, one of the breakaway trio, Austria Kiesenhofer, made a solo break 40 km from the finishing line, which was something she had always planned to do.
Two members of the original breakaway group, Shapira and Plichta, stayed in contention but Kiesenhofer kept pulling away as the chasers were eventually caught by the pack headed by the strong Dutch riders. Gold looked inevitable for the Austrian rider and van Vletuten set off in search of the silver to make amends for her horrific crash 6 km from the finish in Rio when she had gold in her sights. She was rewarded with second place in Tokyo, with Italy Elisa Longo Borghini crossing the line for a second successive bronze medal. One of the lasting memories from the 2020 Olympics was van Vleuten crossing the finishing line raising her arms believing she had won gold, unaware that honour had already gone to Kiesenhofer over a minute earlier. Perhaps it would have been a different story had radio technology been allowed at the Olympics.
Victory for Kiesenhofer was the unlikeliest in women Olympic road race history. She obtained a maths degree from Cambridge University and went into the Games without a major professional cycling contract. She came away from the Games as the first Austrian cycling medallist since Adolf Schmal back in 1896, the first Austrian, male or female, to win a road race medal, and the first Austrian female to win a medal in any cycling discipline.

She would be supported by teammates that included Nicole Cooke, who had won the 2008 Olympic road race, and Emma Pooley, a former British road race titleholder and Olympic time trial medalist. The favorite in the race, however, was considered to be Marianne Vos of the Netherlands who, among numerous other accolades, had won the Olympic Points Race four years earlier in Beijing, the last two editions of the Giro dâItalia Femminile, and silver medals in the road race at the last five World Championships (in addition to her victory at the 2006 edition). Other strong competitors were Italy Giorgia Bronzini, who was the World Champion in the event in 2010 and 2011, Shelley Olds of the strong United States team, and Germany Ina-Yoko Teutenberg, the bronze medalist from the 2011 World Championships, all of whom were thought to be capable of a powerful sprint finish. A notable absence was France Jeannie Longo-Ciprelli, who had appeared in every edition of the Olympic women road race since its inception in 1984 (a then-joint record of seven appearances for a woman) and was its champion in 1996.
London rains soaked the course before and throughout the race and helped keep the breakaways down during the first 100km. With 40 km left to go, however, an otherwise innocuous breakaway by Russian Olga Zabelinskaya turned into a serious threat when she was joined by Vos and, soon after, Armitstead and Olds. When Olds punctured a tire, the field was reduced to three and the breakaway was firmly established, the intermittent downpours now working in the leadersâ favor by keeping the rest of the pack at bay. The final moments came down to the strong sprinting powers of Vos and Armitstead and, in the end, Vos took home the gold. Armitstead silver finish was Britain first medal of the Games and was followed later in the day by a bronze from Becky Adlington in the Women 400 metre freestyle. Zabelinskaya finished in third for the road race bronze, following the footsteps of her father Sergey Sukhoruchenkov, who had won the men road race at the 1980 Summer Olympics.

They thought there was only an individual race in 1948 and simply got on the bus after the ride, and were back in Belgium the next day. They were never given gold medals at the London Olympics. But Van Roosbroeck later learned that they had won the team event and petitioned the IOC to have medals awarded to them. On 9 June 2010, EugÃ¨ne Van Roosbroeck finally received his gold medal for this event, presented to him by IOC President Jacques Rogge.

It was played between the United States and France.  The U.S. squad was made up of American football players from California colleges, notably Stanford, California, and Santa Clara.  The French team was composed of players from four clubs near Paris: Racing Club de France, Olympique Paris, Club AthlÃ©tique des Sports GÃ©nÃ©raux, and the Sporting Club Universitaire de Paris.  In a major upset the United States won, 8-0, despite most of the players being fairly new to the sport of rugby football.  The United States scored with a try (five points) and a field goal (three points), both in the second half.
One of the United States team members, Rudy Scholz of the University of Santa Clara, wrote about the Olympic match for a local paper, âAbout the game.  It started at 5 PM, (time here for all big matches) and there was a crowd of about 20,000 present, despite the fact it was raining.  At a council of war we decided that because the ground was wet and slippery and the ball likewise, we would make it a forward game.  The French tried a backfield game, and they lost although they were fast.  The slippery ball and field proved their undoing.  Our forwards outweighed the French easily, and âBabeâ Slater was a wonder in the line-outs, as was Mahoney, Fish, and Tilden.  We in the backfield didnât have one passing rush, but our defense was superb, and Templeton did not have one tackle to make.  Those from Santa Clara in the final line up were [James] Fitzpatrick, [John] Muldoon, [John] OâNeil and myself.  Bill Muldoon and [James] Winston did not play.  Score end of first half 0-0.  Middle of second half our forwards dribbled to the French ten yard line and then we marked a kick directly in front of the goal and [âDinkâ] Templeton put it over 3-0.  Latter part of second half we dribbled to their five yard line and when the French first five fumbled, [Joseph] Hunter picked it up and fell over the line.  Converted.  Final score 8-0.â
After the Olympic competition, the U.S. Olympic rugby team toured France and played four games.  On 19 September, in Lyons, the U.S. team defeated a team representing the southeast of France, 26-0.  A southern French team then lost to the U.S. team in Toulouse, 14-3, and then at Bordeaux, a southwest French team lost, 6-3.  Finally, in Paris, on 10 October, a French national team defeated the U.S., 14-5.
Rugby football had been contested at the 1919 Inter-Allied Games, with a round-robin tournament between France, Romania, and the United States.  Both France and the United States defeated Romania, and France then defeated the United States, 8-3, on 29 June 1919 to win the event.

South Africa and New Zealand declined their invitations and Ireland, Scotland and Wales completely ignored theirs.  This left just Australia, England, and France as the participating nations.  England was originally scheduled to meet France with the winners taking on Australia but one week before the match France withdrew on the grounds that they could not raise a representative team and the two remaining teams, Australia and England, met in the only rugby match of the 1908 Games.
The Australians had no difficulty in selecting their team as their top players were already touring in England.  By the time of the Olympic rugby match, Australia had played eight matches, winning seven of them.  Conversely, the best Anglo-Welsh players were on tour in Australia and New Zealand and the Olympic match was scheduled to take place shortly after their return home.  A letter was sent to the tourists asking if they would be prepared to accept an Olympic committment so soon after an arduous tour but the letter was never received.  In the ensuing silence it was decided that Cornwall, who had won the English County Championship in March, should be Great Britain Olympic representatives.  During the course of their tour the Australians had already beaten Cornwall (18-5) three weeks before the Games and they scored a more emphatic victory (32-3) in the Olympic match.  The match was played on a dismal day, described by The Times as, â. . . a dark afternoon in a Scotch mist.  The ground was slippery and the footballs in a perpetual state of greasiness.â
Notable among the Australians were Danny Carroll, who won a second gold medal representing the United States in 1920, and Syd Middleton, who rowed in the Australian eight at the 1912 Games.  The Australian team continued to tour Great Britain and finished their tour with 26 wins and 5 losses, scoring 438 points, while conceding only 146.  The other members of the touring Australian rugby team, who did not play at the Olympics, were William Dix, H. Daly, Edward Mandible, Esmend Parkinson, Warden Prentice, J. M. Stevenson, Frederick Wood, Dr. Herbert M. Moran (the captain, who had injured his shoulder the previous Saturday), E. McIntyre, Kenneth Gavin, Peter H. Burge, Albert P. Burge, Norman E. Row, Peter Flanagan, and C. A. Hammons.  C. Murnin was also to be a touring member but had been taken ill in Naples on the trip to England and returned to Australia. The captain, Dr. Moran, in his autobiography, Viewless Winds, noted that his greatest achievement as captain was to get the team home after five months away without a single player contracting venereal disease!

Whilst the family had produced individual medallists and team gold medal winners the one thing missing from the family CV was an Olympic gold medal in an individual event.
Montano entered the Olympics as a bronze medallist from the 2013 World Championships but the favourites for the title were reigning world champion and #1 seed Volodymyr Lukashenko of Ukraine and Russian Stanislav Pozdnyakov, who had won the 2011 and 2012 World titles.
All proceeded smoothly until the quarter finals where Lukashenko, Pozdnyakov and reigning champion Mihai Covaliu fell in quick succession.
After an easy semi-final victory against Dmitry Lapkes of Belarus, Montano met with tougher opposition in the form of Hungary Zsolt Nemcsik in the final. Montano had to fight back from an early 5-1 deficit and a warning for arguing with the officials, to take victory in a bout which went to the last possible point.  The Italian team marked his victory by hurling him into the air in celebration.

In fact it didnât - but only because the Russian didnât even get that far this time.
Pozdnyakov conqueror was the French champion Nicolas Lopez who made the most of his opportunity by making a run to the final which also included a victory over Sydney Olympic champion Mihai Covaliu.

Zhong Man, representing the host nation of China, was a distance runner turned basketball player turned fencer from the same Jiangsu Province that had produced Luan Jujie, the only other Chinese Olympic champion fencer. Zhong had been a solid if unspectacular competitor on the world scene until he won the Asian Championships earlier in 2008. He brought forward this rich vein of form to the Olympic Games. The Chinese and French fencers traded scores for the majority of the final and were tied at 4-all, 6-all and 9-all before Zhong went on a run of six successive scores to become the 1st Chinese male to win Olympic gold in the sport.

The first semi-final was between Zagunis and Kim and appeared to be going the way of all previous Olympic bouts involving Zagunis when the American sprinted into a 12-5 but the Korean was made of strong material and mounted a ferocious comeback to tie things up at all before winning the final two points of the match and ending Zagunis undefeated Olympic run stretching back to the Athens Olympics. The other semi-final went on similar lines but this time the comeback by Olha Kharlan of Ukraine against Velikaya faltered at the last and the Russian held her nerve to register the final decisive pair of hits.

However she was then blessed by a piece of good luck when the Nigerian Olympic Committee announced that it would not be taking up the qualifying position earned by its top female fencer. Suddenly Zagunis was back in contention.
Ranked only at #3 of the three woman US team,  Zagunis was a revelation as the tournament progressed and, as more experienced fencers were defeated, she continued to win and found herself facing former World Champion Tan Xue of China for the Olympic championship. The American youngster galloped into an 8-2 lead and, while the Chinese fencer fought back to close the margin to just three points at one stage, Zagunis rallied to record a comfortable victory by 15-9.

Despite a lean 2007, hopes were still high that America could make a mark at the Beijing Olympics but what happened next was surely beyond their wildest dreams. When reigning world champion Yelena Nechayeva exited early the American trio took advantage and went through to the semi-final along with Russia Sofiya Velikaya whose victory over China Tan Xue had removed another major threat to US glory.  The first semi-final saw Velikaya fall to Sada Jacobson to ensure an all-American final where Jacobson would be joined by defending champion Zagunis. Zagunis went on to defend her crown in straightforward fashion and was never headed in her 15-8 win over Jacobson. The bronze medal bout was more competitive and was only decided in favour of American Becca Ward when officials made a video review of a hit with the scores level at 14 all. After deliberations Ward was deemed to have struck the winning score fractionally before Velikaya landed her blow.

The results in the 1932 Official Report for places 7-14 are almost certainly wrong. Only final results are given in that book, with no series listed. The only 1932 source that gives a complete series for the shot put is the Finnish report, Olympialaiskisat Los Angelesissa 1932. It lists the results as we have given here, several of which are confirmed by several other 1932 newspaper reports, mainly concerning the Finnish putter, Kalle JÃ¤rvinen. It appears that whoever transcribed the official results for the 1932 Official Report transposed the marks in the third round (for places 7-14 at least) into the column for the final results. The 1932 Official Report lists places 7-14 (in Imperial measure) as follows:  7) JÃ³zsef DarÃ¡nyi (HUN) 48-11/2 (14.67); 8) Jules NoÃ«l (FRA) 47-8 (14.53); 9) Zygmunt Heljasz (POL) 47-6â (14.49); 10) Harry Hart (RSA) 46-7â (14.22); 11) Clement Duhour (FRA) 45-91/2 (13.96); 12) Kalle JÃ¤rvinen (FIN) 45-71/2 (13.91); 13) Paul Winter (FRA) 43-11/4 (13.14); 14) Pedro Elsa (ARG) 36-91/4 (11.21).
There are multiple other contemporary sources from 1932 with slightly differing results. We think the following is the best estimate of the final results but, suffice to say, it  should not be assumed that they are 100% accurate. Notably, there is an Austrian report that Emil Janausch did compete but did not advance from the qualifying round. There are also Brazilian reports that their athlete, AntÃ´nio Lira, did record a mark, 12.96, however, that report was only published three months after the Games ended.

Horgan had been AAA champion in 1893-99 and 1904-05, and would win again in 1908-1910.  Rose was the Olympic champion in 1904, 1908, and 1912 in this event, and won the AAU championship in 1907-1910.
The rules in force were those of the United States, rather than Britain.  The jury had a difficult time deciding who was putting the shot and who was throwing it, the primary offender apparently being the Finn, Verner JÃ¤rvinen, who was favored in Rose/Horgan absence, but had no fair efforts.  In the absence of the world top putters, Martin Sheridan won the event, but his mark was mediocre.  Either Rose or Horgan would have surpassed it easily.

This was one of the many events affected.
This original result would stand for five years but in 2013 it was announced that  a retest of a urine sample given by Mikhnevich at the 2005 IAAF World Athletics Championships had, with the use of updated testing techniques, revealed the presence of no less than three banned substances. Since the Belarussian had previously served a doping ban between 2001 and 2003, this second offense was punishable by a lifetime suspension and all of his performances since the 2005 World Championships were automatically voided by the IAAF.  In 2014 the Canadian Olympic Committee announced that the IOC had confirmed that Armstrong was promoted to the bronze medal position in place of Mikhnevich. Armstrong received his bronze medal on 15 February 2015, in his hometown of Kamloops, British Columbia, almost 7 years after the event had ended.

He also won 17 Irish titles with the shot and 11 in other weight-throwing events.  Horgan would possibly have won the shot put gold medal in the Olympics of 1900, 1904, and 1906 but he did not compete at those Olympics.

In round six, Carter produced a PR effort of 20.63, bettering her previous best by almost one foot (30 cm), and stunningly moved ahead of Adams with only one throw remaining. Adams produced a good effort, 20.39, to try to catch Carter, but would only take silver. Carter had won the first shot put gold medal by an American woman. In the final round, Hungarian Anita MÃ¡rton threw 19.87 to push Gong off the podium and win bronze.
Carter was the daughter of Mike Carter, the Olympic men shot put silver medallist at the 1984 Olympics, who later played nine years in the NFL, all with the San Francisco 49ers, and played on three Super Bowl Championship teams.

72274,"Single Sticks, Individual, Men",1904 Summer Olympics,3,Fencing,08 September 1904,"Physical Culture Gymnasium, Washington University, St. Louis",3 from 1 countries,na,na,"Single stick fencing was a form of fencing using either a single wooden stick or similar to sabre but with a wooden stick replacing the metal blade. Instead of a metal guard to protect the hand, a wicker basket or thick leather guard was usually used. The single stick was used initially as a way to train fencers using equipment that was less expensive and less subject to breakage but evolved into a competitive event.
As sword fighting on the battlefield became rare, soldiers in the Army were taught foil fencing because they were only likely to need to know sword fighting for formal duels. Sailors in the Navy were taught sabre fencing because they were likely to need sword fighting when boarding enemy ships where sabre techniques would be more beneficial. Sabres made out of metal, though, were expensive and prone to breakage because of the state of metallurgy at that time and so fencing techniques were usually taught using single sticks. By the early 1900s, the boarding of ships and hand-to-hand combat were no longer being done and so single stick fencing ceased being practiced. Single sticks was only contested at the Olympics in 1904. There were only three competitors and it was won easily by Albertson Van Zo Post who scored 11 touches against 8 by the runner-up, William Scott OâConnor.

Julin-Mauroy won the gold medal despite not being placed first by any judge, the only time this has ever happened in the Olympics.  A measure of the anti-German sentiment of the time was evidenced by the choice of music for Julin-Mauroy free skating program.  She had trained to âAn der schÃ¶nen blauen Donau,â a German song, but it was forbidden, and she had to change music at the last minute.
The 1920 Olympic Games was the only time that Magda Julin-Mauroy competed in international skating.  NorÃ©n was better known.

Weld-Blanchard was the first North American women champion (1923) and she and Niles won the North American pairs title in 1925.
Weld-Blanchard actually deserved the silver medal, and figure skating historian Benjamin Wright has noted, âThe day after the ladies event, a re-tabulation of the marks showed that Theresa Weld had in fact earned more points than Svea NorÃ©n of Sweden, and deserved the silver medal.  The judges had approximated her points and awarded ordinals and the medals accordingly.  A protest was never made and the results stood as originally announced.

Shea was the 1999 World Champion, and also the third Shea to compete in the Winter Games, after his father Jim and grandfather Jack. Shea had delivered the oath at the opening ceremony, and was the emotional favourite, as his grandfather Jack, two-time Olympic speed skating champion in 1932, had been killed by a drunk driver a month before the Olympics. But he was expected to have fierce competition from the European riders. These included 1994 World Champion Gregor StÃ¤hli (SUI), the best rider of the 2001/2002 season, 2001 World Champion Martin Rettl (AUT), 1998 World Champion and World Cup winner Willi Schneider (GER), among others.
But Shea won the first run by 0.13 seconds, ahead of Rettl and the competition big surprise, the Irish Baron of Wrottesley. A British nobleman living in Ireland, he was not even considered an outsider until the Olympic training runs, which prompted a newspaper article title âOâCool Runningsâ, referring to the Disney movie about the Jamaican bobsledders a decade earlier. But Wrottesley slid back into 4th position after the second and final run, which was slightly influenced by snowfall. Shea almost lost his lead to Rettl, but encouraged by a picture of Jack Shea he hid in his helmet, he kept his lead to become the first American Olympic skeleton champion since 1928.

Although Chapuis had taken silver at the 2015 World Championships, and had a few recent World Cup victories, neither he nor his compatriot were the favorites for the event in 2018. That distinction went to Marc Bischofberger of Switzerland, who was first in the World Cup rankings at the time of the Games. Sweden Victor Ãhling Norberg, the reigning World Champion, was also a contender, while the 2015 edition of that tournament was won by Slovenia Filip Flisar.
Each round of the ski cross was divided into heats of four competitors, with the top two advancing. The course in PyeongChang was particularly brutal and, due to the number of athletes who crashed during training, was modified shortly prior to the final in order to make it safer. The changes were not enough for Canadian Christopher Del Bosco, a three-time Olympian and multiple medalist at the Winter X Games, whose crash was so bad that the quarterfinals were delayed while medical professionals checked up on him and then removed him from the course. Still, with the exception of the eliminated Norberg, the rest of the skiers pressed on. Chapuis came last in his heat during the quarterfinals, while Flisar and Bovolenta dropped out in the semifinals. This left Bischofberger facing Russia Sergey Ridzik and two Canadians, Brady Leman and Kevin Drury.
Of the three, Leman was the most distinguished, having been the 2016 Winter X Games Champion. He had also been the fourth skier in the final at the 2014 Olympics, but had crashed during his run, paving the way for the French medal sweep. His luck four years later, however, was much better, as he managed to beat the favored Bischofberger down the course and capture the gold medal, leaving the Swiss competitor with silver. Ridzik and Drury, on the other hand, crashed into one another, and while Drury ski came off, disqualifying him, Ridzik held on to his equipment, got up, and made it down the hill to claim the final podium spot.

The result was as unlikely as it could be as Chapuis won the gold medal, leading a French medal sweep, followed by Arnaud Bovolenta and Jonathan Midol.
Despite Chapuis 2013 World title, he had won only one World Cup race in 32 starts, and Bovolenta and Midol had never even made a World Cup podium previously. Bovolenta previous best result was a sixth place earned earlier in the season at Val Thorens, while Midol best World Cup finish was a fourth place in 2012/13 at Les Contamines. Midol brother, Bastien, was much better known, having won the silver medal at the 2013 Worlds. Jonathan Midol fell shortly before the finish of the final and sprawled across the finish line for his bronze, but Leman could not contest the medal, having skidded and fallen early in the final run, conceding the medals to the French threesome.
The carnage from the course was best typified in the first quarter-final, won by Switzerland Armin Niederer, who was the only skiier to cross the line standing. Behind him three skiiers crashed and fell near the finish, with Russian Yegor Korotkov finishing second as he rolled over the line.

After reviewing the race, however, the judges created some controversy by handing Smith a yellow card for improper contact with Maier on the final jump. Despite protests from both skiers, this bumped Maier into the bronze medalist position, while some spectators claimed that similar actions from Thompson were ignored. After the Games ended, however, an appeals commission for the sport determined that the contact âwas neither intentional [n]or unavoidableâ and that Maier had finished officially in fourth, giving Smith the bronze medal. However, this was appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and in December 2022, the CAS decision was to award two bronze medals for the event, to Maier and Smith, which was approved by the IOC.

Serwa had been the runner-up at the 2014 Games and had captured the gold medal at the 2016 Winter X Games, but a serious training accident had nearly ended her career in December of 2016.

The piste was located between the men and women speed course within the Rosa Khutor Alpine Center. The start was at an altitude of 1,160 metres and the run ended as all other Alpine skiing events in the same finishing area. The first run started in the late afternoon with cloudy weather, with spring-like temperatures between 7 (start) and 10 (finish) degrees, while the second run was held as a night-race under floodlights with a clear sky and temperatures still between 5 and 6 degrees. The snow was a main factor in this race. A lot of salt was scattered as it was necessary to firm up the snow surface, which was softened by high temperatures. But this refroze the surface causing problems as it soon become weak again and turned into slush.
The season underway saw seven World Cup slaloms held with only Marcel Hirscher (Levi and Adelboden) and Felix Neureuther (Bormio and KitzbÃ¼hel) winning twice. The other races were won by Mario Matt (Val dâIsÃ¨re), Alexis Pinturault (Wengen), and Henrik Kristoffersen, who won the last World Cup slalom prior to the Games in Schladming. The current standings saw Hirscher in the lead followed by Neureuther and Kristoffersen. Hirscher also won the slalom World title in 2013 and the slalom World Cup of the last season 2012/13. Neureuther placed second both times, but his condition was uncertain after a car accident in Germany a week earlier, which caused a whiplash injury. Also considered to be strong were Jean-Baptiste Grange (World champion in 2011) and the Swedes AndrÃ© Myhrer (slalom World Cup winner 2011-12) and Mattias Hargin.
Going first on the fresh snow Myhrer (SWE) set the target time of 47.15. His compatriot, Hargin, was next to go and he too set a good time of 47.45. Third skier down, Matt (AUT), was to set the fastest time of the first run in 46.70. None of the other skiers was able to better any of these times, although Stefano Gross (ITA), starting 17th, managed to equal the time of Hargin for joint third place.
The second run was, like the slalom part of the Super Combined six days earlier, set by Ivica KosteliÄ father Ante. He, not for the first time, created an unusual and controversial course. Ted Ligety called it âborderline unsportsmanlikeâ, but as always, KosteliÄ answered that the top skiers also had to be smart and they should be able to race this run. With the top 30 going in reverse order the second run produced all the drama, with the early leader being Kristoffersen (NOR), starting 1.79 seconds behind Matt in 15th place, posting a combined time of 1:42.67. This time was not challenged until Hirscher (AUT), ninth after the first run, put in a storming run of 54.14 to go into the lead with a combined time of 1:42.12. Remarkably the next four skiers, Pinturault (FRA), Neureuther (GER), Ligety (USA), and Grange (FRA) all failed to finish the course. Hargin second run contained mistakes and he couldnât repeat his finish of the first run, eventually finishing down in joint seventh. Gross, for a while, threatened to get into the medals and his combined time of 1:42.72 was good enough to put him in joint third place at that stage. When Myhrer also failed to complete the course, it came down to Matt second run to determine the medals. His experience was to carry him through and, whilst only the sixth fastest run, came through with a combined time of 1:41.84 to take the final Alpine skiing gold medal of the Games. Adam Å½ampa (SVK), with a time of 53.94, skied the fastest second run but, having been 26th after the first run, was never in contention for a medal and finished sixth.
Matt, who turned 35 years of age in April 2014, became the oldest Olympic Alpine skiing champion ever, while bronze medalist Kristoffersen, only 19, became the ever youngest male Olympic Alpine skier on the podium. Matt, skiing on Blizzards, won the only Alpine skiing medal for them in Sochi, while silver was won on Atomic, and bronze on Rossignol. Finishing 43th and last in this race was French-born Yohan GonÃ§alves the first ever Winter Olympic competitor from Timor-Leste. Hubertus von Hohenlohe did not have the luck to finish the race when he struggled in the first run. It was only the second time he failed to finish in 15 Olympic events in six Olympic Winter Games over a period of 30 years. With his six participations he equalled the record for Alpine skiers held by Marco BÃ¼chel and became the oldest ever Alpine skiing competitor aged 55.

Poor weather had caused all sorts of problems with other alpine skiing events, and foggy weather was prevalent throughout this, the last race in Whistler, although it was completed.

His second run time of 51.07 was to be the second fastest time of the second run and his combined time of 1:40.66 would be good enough for 8th place. Cousineau held his lead until Andre Myhrer surpassed it with a second run of 50.73 (the quickest) and a combined time of 1:39.76. KosteliÄ, 4th after the first run, then had a good run to take the overall lead with a time of 1:39.48. Raich had a few minor errors, but it was enough to cost him time, finishing in 1:39.81 that was to be just outside the medals. ValenÄiÄ had a poor second run, eventually finishing down in 6th place.

Razzoli won the second gold medal at this Games for skiing manufactor Nordica, the same as used by bronze medalist Myhrer, while KosteliÄ trusted Fischer for silver.

He was also the 2017 World Champion. His primary challenger was Henrik Kristoffersen, who won the slalom World Cup in 2015/16 and was also in second place in the slalom World Cup. These two were also the silver (Hirscher) and bronze (Kristoffersen) medalists from Sochi, while the gold medalist from four years ago, Mario Matt, had since retired. The two city events held this winter, which counted for the slalom World Cup, were won by AndrÃ© Myhrer and Ramon ZenhÃ¤usern. Also considered medal contenders were Michael Matt and Daniel Yule, who had had good seasonal performances.
Kristoffersen, bib #4, took the lead with a great run and when Hirscher started just behind him with bib #5 everyone expected an exciting battle, but Hirscher run ended after 22 seconds when he missed a gate. It was the first time in two years that he did not finish a slalom, since February 2016 in Naeba, Japan. The first run ended with Myhrer in second place only 0.21 seconds behind Kristoffersen and the surprise Victor Muffat-Jeandet in third.

After Mario Matt became the oldest ever slalom Olympic champion in Sochi, Myhrer set a new age record to become the oldest slalom gold medalist in Olympic history aged 35-042, only nine days younger than Aksel Lund Svindal in his downhill win seven days before. The silver for ZenhÃ¤usern was the Switzerland first Olympic medal in men slalom since Edy Reinalter won gold back in 1948.
With Michael Matt winning bronze, he continued the family tradition, after his brothers Andreas (silver in Vancouver) and Mario (gold in Sochi) had won medals at the previous Games to give the Matt family a full set of medals. The gold medal was the second for Sweden, after Ingemar Stenmark win in 1980, and, as Frida Hansdotter won gold six days earlier in the women slalom, both slalom golds went to Sweden. This was the second time in history a nation was able to win both slalom titles at the Olympics after Marielle Goitschel and Jean-Claude Killy respectively did so for France in 1968.

Start Altitude : 1,712 m Vertical Drop  : 211 m   ","The women slalom was the second female Alpine skiing event in Beijing. There were two clear favourites for this event with Petra VlhovÃ¡ and Mikaela Shiffrin. They had won all seven slaloms held in the ongoing World Cup season, with VlhovÃ¡ winning in Levi (twice), Lienz, Zagreb, and Kranjska Gora, while Shiffrin triumphed in Killington and Schladming. VlhovÃ¡ also topped the standings with Shiffrin second, followed by Wendy Holdener, Lena DÃ¼rr, and Katharina Liensberger.
Since the last Olympics in 2018, Shiffrin had won the Crystal Globe in 2018 and 2019, VlhovÃ¡ in 2020, and Liensberger in 2021, with the world titles going to Shiffrin in 2019 and Liensberger in 2021. A question mark was left as to who would take gold after VlhovÃ¡ only finished 14th, and Shiffrin did not finish in the first technical event in Beijing two days earlier, when neither had been at their best. Interestingly, their coaches had been chosen to set the courses with Mike Day in the first run and Mauro Pini in the second run.
The race was opened by bib number 1 DÃ¼rr, and it turned out that her performance would be the best on the first run with Gisin only 3/100ths of a second behind. Surprisingly placed third after the first run was giant slalom gold medallist Sara Hector, only 0.11 seconds behind the lead. In fourth was another surprise with Andreja Slokar, followed by Holdener in fifth, with Liensberger and VlhovÃ¡ in seventh and eighth respectively, both already more than 6/10ths behind DÃ¼rr. It was even worse for Shiffrin, as the course setting of her coach was no help and she went out after only about five seconds racing.
In the second run, VlhovÃ¡ took advantage of the course setting of her coach and stormed with the best run time to take the gold medal. Liensberger going down just after VlhovÃ¡ set the second-best time to win silver as none of the others from the best six after run one were able to catch them. Holdener took bronze 0.12 behind VlhovÃ¡ and 0.04 behind Liensberger, but finished 0.07 ahead of midway leader DÃ¼rr. As fifth placed Slokar was also only 0.22 behind VlhovÃ¡, this was the closest women Olympic slalom ever.
This was the first ever medal for Slovakia in an Alpine skiing event. With VlhovÃ¡ and Liensberger, the manufacturer Rossignol won two medals, while Holdener won bronze for Head, allowing this brand to win a medal in each of the first four races in Beijing. A record number of 51 nations participated in this event, which was the highest number of different countries to do so in a female Olympic Alpine skiing event ever. Finishing 50th and last was Lee Wen-Yi, who became the first ever Olympic Alpine skier for Chinese Taipei.

The first run started in late afternoon and the second run was held as a night-race under floodlights. The current slalom World Cup season saw Mikaela Shiffrin winning three races in Levi, Bormio, and Flachau, while Marlies Schild won in Courchevel and Lienz, and Frida Hansdotter topped the result in the last race before the Olympics in Kranjska Gora. This brought Shiffrin in the lead of the standings followed by Hansdotter, Marlies Schild, and Marie-MichÃ¨le Gagnon. Marlies Schild was the 2011 World champion and also won the slalom World Cup in 2010/11 and 2011/12 with Shiffrin as  reigning 2013 World chamipon and 2012/13 slalom World Cup winner. With her 35th career win in Lienz, Marlies Schild also overtook Vreni Schneider in the list of all-time slalom World Cup wins. So all was focused on a generational duel between the young 18-year-old superstar Mikaela Shiffrin and 32-year-old grand dame Marlies Schild.
In the opening run the early skiers would post the fastest times. Going first, the pace was set by Bernadette Schild (AUT) with a time of 53.41. This didnât last long as Super Combined champion and Vancouver slalom gold medalist Maria HÃ¶fl-Riesch (GER) overtook this with 53.11. Two skiers later Tina Maze (SLO), Giant Slalom champion, set a time of 53.29 to challenge the leaders. But easily the fastest was Mikaela Shiffrin (USA) who skied the course in 52.62 to take a lead of almost half a second into the second run. Coming next with bib number 7 was Marlies Schild, but she lost more than 1.3 seconds and finished the first run only in sixth position.
With the top 30 going in reverse order in the second run, Frida Hansdotter (SWE) had the fourth fastest time down the course to finish with a combined time of 1:45.90. Next down the course was Kathrin Zettel, seventh after the first run but powering to the second fastest time on the second run to take the lead with 1:45.35. Sixth after the first run, Marlies Schild (AUT) then set the new target time of 1:45.07, having posted the fastest time on the second run with 51.11. Maze then had a poor second run to finish in 1:46.25, ultimately placing eighth. As the course deteriorated HÃ¶fl-Riesch was relatively slow and her combined time of 1:45.73 finish fourth. Going last, Shiffrin, despite a mistake on the course, when she almost fell backwards and had to recover, held her nerve with the sixth fastest time of the run, winning gold over the two Austrians by a margin of 0.53 seconds.
Shiffrin became the youngest ever Olympic slalom champion and her idol Marlies Schild became the first women to win a third medal in the same Alpine skiing event after silver in Vancouver and bronze in Torino. Skiing manufacturer Atomic, who did not win a single medal before this event, made a clean sweep of the podium.

Among non-Americans, Sweden Henrik Harlaut was the most recent Winter X Games champion and Fabian BÃ¶sch of Switzerland was the 2015 World Champion; both were challengers for podium spots.
The competition in this event at the 2018 Games was fierce, with eight of the qualifiers posting best scores of over 90 points in the opening round. They were led by Oscar Wester of Sweden, a veteran skier, but one without any major titles to his name. In an additional shocking twist, Williams, Harlaut, and BÃ¶sch were all eliminated with mediocre runs. The surprise in the final, meanwhile, came from Norway Ãystein BrÃ¥ten, who was the 2017 Winter X Games Champion and the 2018 runner-up. BrÃ¥ten posted a score of 95.00 on his first run, which was far ahead of the field at that time and was never surpassed, earning him the gold medal.
The competition heated up in the second round with two competitors, Alex Beaulieu-Marchand of Canada and James Woods of Great Britain, both scoring over 90 points. Beaulieu-Marchand had taken bronze at the 2017 Winter X Games, while Woods had done the same at that year World Championships. In the final round, however, Goepper came back from two mediocre runs and scored an impressive 93.60, enough to secure silver and leave Beaulieu-Marchand with bronze. Wester crashed twice and left with only a mediocre score while Kenworthy, hampered by recent injuries, was unable to perform to the best of his ability and placed last.

The favorite was Canadian Kaya Turski, the 2013 World Champion and 2014 Winter X champion, but she was sick during her entire stay in Sochi and would not make it out of qualifying, leaving the event somewhat open.
Warm temperatures at the Rosa Khutor Extreme Park made the snow very soft. Canada still managed to put three skiiers in the final, and Dara Howell powered over the slushy course on the first run of the final to post 94.20 and lead American Devin Logan, who trailed with 85.40. After falling on her first run, Canadian Kim Lamarre posted the best second run score with 85.00. Nobody could better Howell and Logan marks from the first run, as they won the gold and silver medals, followed by Lamarre, who took bronze. Another medal favorite, American Keri Herman, had difficulty with the soft snow conditions and placed only 10th.
Paraguay made their Winter Olympic dÃ©but in this event, courtesy of Julia Marino, who was born in Paraguay, but grew up just outside Boston, Massachusetts. Based on her World Cup results, Marino came to Sochi as a medal contender, but struggled and did not get out of the qualifying round, placing 17th.

At those Games, the winner of the slopestyle contest had been Canadian Dara Howell, but the fervor surrounding her triumph took an emotional toll and caused her skiing to suffer. Even after a year break from competition, she had produced only mediocre results on the international stage and was therefore not considered a particular favorite. The other medal winners from those Games, Devin Logan of the United States and Kim Lamarre of Canada, had also been inconsistent in recent years, leaving the competition in 2018 relatively e open. France Tess Ledeux was the reigning World Champion and was considered a fair bet to take gold, and certainly one of the favorites.
The qualification round proved difficult for many of the key figures in the tournament; Ledeux posted a moderate score in her first run and crashed out on her second, while both Howell and Lamarre fell victim to botched landings and were eliminated. While attention might have been focused the unlucky favorites in this round, there was no shortage of excellent runs from other competitors, and thus even Ledeux more successful first attempt failed to take her to the finals. Leading the qualifiers was Sweden Emma DahlstrÃ¶m, the 2015 Winter X Games champion and the 2017 World runner-up, with several others not far behind.
In the final, it was the relatively unheralded Swiss duo of Mathilde Gremaud and Sarah HÃ¶fflin who stole the show. Gremaud executed a difficult trick from the get-go and came out on top after the first run, while HÃ¶fflin held back somewhat, but still managed to perform impressively enough to land in second. Both skiers fell on their second run, but while Gremaud also failed in her third run, HÃ¶fflin successfully completed a complicated trick in her third run and earned a well-deserved gold medal. No one else topped Gremaud score from the first run, leaving her with silver, while Izzy Atkin of Great Britain, the 2017 World bronze medalist and 2018 Winter X Games runner-up, snatched bronze away from Maggie Voisin of the United States, the 2018 Winter X Games champion. This was Great Britain first-ever podium finish in freestyle skiing.

The officials ruled that the ground was obviously not artificial and that the shooters therefore could rest their rifles on the ground.  Strangely, only the Swedish team seemed to know about this, and they took full advantage of the knowledge, resting both the left hand and forearm and the butt of the rifle on the firing line.

The limit for entrants per nation in all individual shooting events was 12.  But the entry forms for George Barnes, the eventual bronze medalist, were lost, and Plater was named as the 12th British entrant in his place.  However, an extension of the deadline for entries was made and Barnes application was eventually accepted.  On the day of the competition, the British team officials lost count of the number of British shooters who had competed in this event.  With only -hour to go before the time limit, they called on Plater to shoot, thinking he was the 12th British shooter in the small-bore rifle when, in fact, he was the 13th - one beyond the limit.  In varying light, a gusty wind, and fine drizzle, he fired his 80 rounds in less than 30 minutes, scoring 391, the leading score and a new world record.  In the initial results issued by the National Rifle Association, and published in The Sporting Life, Plater was listed as the winner.
But the error of Britain having 13 competitors was then discovered and it took several days to sort out the error.  It was not certain if Plater or Barnesâ mark would be deleted from the official results, but eventually Plater was declared an unofficial entrant and not given an Olympic medal.  But in October 1908, Philip Plater was presented a special gold medal and a record diploma by the British Olympic Council.

Only one event was held, a fancy diving competition on springboard.  A St. Louis doctor, Dr. George Sheldon, won the competition, defeating Germany Georg Hoffmann fairly easily.  The controversy in this event occurred in the battle for the bronze medal.  The American, Frank Kehoe, and a German, Alfred Braunschweiger, tied for third with 11.33 points.  The Germans protested this result, thinking that Braunschweiger had easily outperformed Kehoe.  A âdive-offâ for third place was scheduled but Braunschweiger refused to compete and Kehoe was awarded the bronze medal.
The German commissioner to the World Fair, Dr. Theodore Lewald, had donated a trophy for the winning diver, but he was so incensed at the outcome that he refused to award it to Sheldon.  The controversy occurred because the Germans thought that they did fancier dives than the Americans, although the Americans protested that the Germans had poorer entries into the water.  The Germans, noting that the event was called a fancy diving contest, thought that was immaterial.  On 29 September, James Sullivan announced the ruling that the protest had not been allowed, although the decision had been made two weeks earlier. The Germans protested again, and this was, at first, overruled.  But two years later, the official result was announced as a tie for third place, although this was never accepted by the Americans, and the final result is disputed.
In many older sources this event is often described as a platform diving event, but that is incorrect. Photos show that it was held off a springboard, and diving historian Bob Clotworthy (1956 springboard gold medalist) has also maintained for several years that this was a springboard event.

Riggin remains the second youngest gold medalist ever in diving, while Riggin and Wainwright still rate as the fifth and sixth youngest diving medalists ever among women Olympians.  Riggin is still the fifth youngest individual gold medalist in Olympic history through 2000.
The women competed on the springboard with the same rules as the men.  The divers had to perform compulsory and optional dives from both the one- and three-metre springboards.  In addition, the divers were required to perform two dives drawn by lot, which were surprise dives disclosed to the contestants just before the competition so that they had no time to practice them.  There were six compulsory dives, four voluntary dives, and two drawn dives.  The required dives were as follows:  #6 - forward dive, hand on sides on entry, header forward, running takeoff; #13 - back dive with half-twist; #26 - forward running 11/2 pike; #34 - inward somersault pike; #37 - reverse dive, layout position, standing takeoff, hands on side at entry (also known as Auerbach or Isander); #46 - reverse dive, pike position, hands on side at entry.

The final was essentially a contest between three Norwegian skiers â Hattestad, Petter Northug and Ãystein Pettersen, and two Russians Aleksandr Panzhinsky, who was the fastest qualifier, and Nikita Kryukov. If the Norwegians had a race plan, it was soon blown away by Panzhinsky who took a commanding lead at the start and maintained that lead for most of the race. The drama happened behind the leaders as Aleksey Poltoranin (KAZ) fell, taking down Hattestad with him. The other two Norwegians fell back by some distance, and going into the home straight Panzhinsky held the lead. However a tremendous surge by Kryukov saw him win by a fraction of a second on the line ahead of his compatriot. Northug finished in the bronze medal position, some distance behind the winner.

Of these, only Belorukova could make any impact on the battle between the two favorites. She stayed on the heels of Nilsson when she started her attack in the second climb. Falla went past the Russian on the inside to move into second place. But Nilsson was clearly superior, and stormed to her first Olympic gold three seconds ahead of Falla.

Six days later, Wasmeier would add another gold medal by winning the giant slalom.

Super-G had been a World Cup event since 1983. The favorite was Pirmin Zurbriggen, who had already won the downhill gold in Calgary, was the 1987 World Champion, and led the World Cup in 1987, and to that time in 1988. The fifth skier off was France Franck Piccard, the bronze medalist in the downhill who had been named after Frank Sinatra. Piccard was initially angry with his time, feeling he had made several mistakes late in the run, but as the remaining seeded skiers came down, his time held up and he had the first Olympic gold medal in the super-G. Zurbriggen had an unusually poor performance for him, finishing tied for fifth. The silver medal went to Austrian Helmut Mayer, who had won one previous World Cup race, a giant slalom in 1987.

The favorites were Michael Walchhofer (leader of the current Super G World Cup), Aksel Lund Svindal (second in the 2009-10 Super G World Cup, winner of the 2008-09 Super G World Cup, and bronze medalist at the 2009 World Championships), Didier Cuche (2009 World Champion and winner at KitzbÃ¼hel in 2010), and Manuel Osborne-Paradis (recent winner at Lake Louise). But Didier DÃ©fago and Bode Miller were also highly considered after winning gold and bronze in the downhill four days earlier. The 2006 medalists Kjetil AndrÃ© Aamodt (gold) retired shortly after Torino, Hermann Maier (silver) retired just before the 2009-10 season, and Ambrosi Hoffmann (bronze) raced only in the downhill in 2010. The only World Cup Super G held on this course was won by Christoph Gruber on 21 February 2008.
The race started at 11:30 AM with perfect sunny weather and temperatures between 3.5Â° (start) and 9Â° (finish). With number 3 the American Andrew Weibrecht set an early quick time. The first of the favorites was Miller in start position 11. He took the lead from the first split to the finish, but he lost time in the second part of the course, and topped the time of his fellow countryman by only 0.03 seconds.  Svindal, who turned 28 on the closing day of the Vancouver Olympics, did not start well, as in the downhill, and at the first intermediate split was 0.3 seconds behind Miller, but he finished quickly to lead by 0.28 seconds at the finish line and take the gold medal. The oldest competitor in the field, Patrik JÃ¤rbyn, hooked a gate and fell in the last section of the course and landed hard on his back and head and was unconscious. He was flown to hospital by helicopter, but luckily was not hurt badly and was able to leave the hospital the next day.
When Svindal came to the leaders area, Miller was laughing and joked with him with some profanity which was broadcast around the world. Svindal won the race with an average speed of 87.67 km/hr by 0.28 seconds or 6.8 metres in front of Miller. The sensation of the race was bronze medalist Weibrecht who had never previously placed better than 10th in a World Cup race. Svindal won the first gold medal for Atomic at this Olympics. Miller, on the same skis as in the downhill and the only one of the top racers on downhill skis, won silver with Head, while Weibrecht took bronze using Rossignol.

He had won all the World Cup Super Gs coming into Nagano and was heavily favored, until he crashed badly, landing on his head, during the Olympic downhill. It was not certain if The Herminator could recover in time for the Super G, but he appeared at the starthouse, with the lead held at the time by his teammate, Hans KnauÃ. Maier skied somewhat conservatively for him, as he was known for his wild, go-for-broke style, probably affected by his serious downhill accident. Still, he bested KnauÃ time by 0.61 seconds, taking the lead, and nobody would challenge that time, bringing Maier the gold medal he most wanted. As the 17th starter, after the seeded skiers had gone off, Switzerland Didier Cuche came down in the same time as KnauÃ and they shared silver medals. Three days later, Maier would add a second gold medal in the giant slalom. In a very long career emphasizing downhill and Super G, Cuche would win the 2009 World Championships in the Super G and add a silver in the downhill.

The course was quite short at 1,650 metres, almost 700 metres shorter than the Calgary super-G and thru 2006, the shortest super-G course by almost 400 metres. Swiss Marco Hangl set the pace as the second skier off, posting 1:13.90. Next up was Aamodt, who moved ahead with 1:13.04. Aamodt was followed by Luxembourgeois Marc Girardelli, likely the greatest skier never to win an Olympic medal to this time.

The ongoing Super G World Cup saw only two different winners in the five races held, with Marco Odermatt winning the season opener in Beaver Creek 1 and the last race before the Olympics, in Wengen. In-between, Aleksander Aamodt Kilde won in Beaver Creek 2, Val Gardena, and Bormio. Both also topped the standings with Kilde first and Odermatt second, followed by the Austrians Matthias Mayer, Vincent Kriechmayr, and Raphael Haaser. Kriechmayr was also Super G Crystal Globe winner in 2021, after finishing second on three consecutive occasions in the previous years, and was also the reigning 2021 World Champion. Dominik Paris won the 2019 Super G World Cup and became World champion the same year, while Kjetil Jansrud won the World Cup trophy in 2018, and Mauro Caviezel in 2020.
Jansrud competed in the Super G, after not taking part in the downhill the day before, but was not at his best after the injury caused by a fall in early December 2021. Caviezel did not participate in Beijing because he was still recovering from concussion sustained in a bad crash in a training run at Garmisch-Partenkirchen in January 2021.
Kilde, wearing bib number 7, was the first of the favourites to go and he overtook Pinturault, who had been leading up to that point by a full second. Wearing bib number 9 was Odermatt, who was seen as Kilde toughest opponent, but he was not able to finish the race and so another Norwegian, Sejersted, settled into second place. Next to race was Kriechmayr, but he only finished in third, 2/100ths of a second behind Sejersted. Wearing bib number 13, Mayer again gave a great Olympic performance and took the lead 0.42 seconds ahead of Kilde. What looked a comfortable lead turned into a nail-biter when the next starter Ryan Cochran-Siegle finished second, only 4/100ths behind the leader. As none of the other competitors were able to come close to a podium finish, the medallists were decided and Mayer repeated his win from four years ago in this event.
Mayer become only the third male skier to win an Alpine skiing event back-to-back after Alberto Tomba (giant slalom 1988 and 1992) and Kjetil AndrÃ© Aamodt (also in Super G 2002 and 2006). Mayer become the fifth male Alpine skier to win three gold medals and also became to most successful Austrian Alpine skier ever. Mayer won the race with an average speed of 102.09 km/h and 1.13 metres ahead of Cochran-Siegle. Like in the downhill, manufacturer Head again won gold, and also silver, but bronze went to Atomic with Kilde.

It was held on the same piste within the Rosa Khutor Alpine Center as the downhill, but the start was moved down to an altitude of 1,592 metres and was located between âSmall Panâ and âRussian Trampolineâ. On race day the weather was partly cloudy and for better conditions the starting time was moved up one hour from 1100 to 1000.
The 2013/2014 World Cup season had seen four Super G races, with Aksel Lund Svindal winning twice (Lake Louise and Val Gardena), while Patrick KÃ¼ng won in Beaver Creek and Didier DÃ©fago in KitzbÃ¼hel. Svindal, Olympic Super G champion four years ago, who also won the last two Super G World Cups in 2011/12 and 2012/13, was also in the World Cup lead, followed by DÃ©fago, KÃ¼ng, and the silver medalist from Vancouver in this discipline, Bode Miller. The last two World championships were won by Christof Innerhofer in 2011 and Ted Ligety in 2013.
Of the early starters Peter Fill (ITA) set the target with a time of 1:18.85. Of the more favored skiers, Miller set the pace with a time of 1:18.67. Next to go was Max Franz (AUT), who finished just 0.07 seconds behind Miller. His compatriot Otmar Striedinger, going next, came even closer to Miller time, finishing just 0.02 seconds behind. Defending champion Aksel Lund Svindal (NOR) was next to go, but he too fell just short of Miller, by 0.11 seconds. Next down the course was downhill champion Matthias Mayer (AUT), who crashed out. Unfortunately for Miller his luck could not hold as, starting 21st, Kjetil Jansrud (NOR) set the new target with a time of 1:18.40. The next skier down, Jan Hudec (CAN) finished in exactly the same time as Miller, at that stage sharing the silver medal. But a relatively late starter Andrew Weibrecht (USA) came through to set a time of 1:18.44, so relegating Hudec and Miller to bronze medals.
Jansrud, who won his second medal in Sochi after bronze in downhill, was a surprise winner, but he continued the Norwegian tradition in this event, following his compatriots Kjetil AndrÃ© Aamodt who won in 2002 and 2006, and Svindal, who won in 2010. But even more surprising was Weibrecht who after winning a surprising bronze in Vancouver in this event, bettered his performance with silver in Sochi, again going from zero-to-hero as his best World Cup result was still only a 10th place at this time. Hudec won the first Alpine skiing medal for Canada after 20 years, Miller, who had lost his younger brother in the last year, showed his emotions in the finishing area after winning his sixth Olympic medal, which also made him the oldest ever Alpine skiing Olympic medalist.
Skiing manufacturer Head earned a full set of medals with Jansrud, Weibrecht, and Miller, while Hudec used Rossignol. Jansrud won the race with an average speed of 96.57 km/hr by 0.30 seconds or 8.02 metres in front of Weibrecht and 0.53 seconds or 14.12 metres in front of Hudec and Miller.

Miller went off 23rd, among the 30 seeds, but straddled a gate and did not finish â the Torino Olympics were not going well for him.

The Norwegians Kjetil Jansrud and Aksel Lund Svindal were the big favorites, after finishing first (Svindal) and second (Jansrud) in the downhill the day before. Jansrud was also the defending champion from 2014 and led the ongoing Super G World Cup with Svindal in second. The Norwegians also ruled the years before, as the last four Super G Crystal Globes were won by Jansrud (2014/15 and 2016/17), Svindal (2013/14) and Kilde (2015/16). This winter season had seen four out of six World Cup Super Gs won by different skiers as Jansrud won in Lake Louise, Kriechmayr in Beaver Creek, Ferstl in Val Gardena, and Svindal in KitzbÃ¼hel.
With a total of seven podium finishes the Austrians would be the primary medal contenders with all four of their racers in this event having top three World Cup finishes prior to PyeongChang. Hannes Reichelt was also the 2015 World Champion, while the reigning 2017 World Champion, Erik Guay, missed the Olympics due to a back injury. The other 2014 medalists, Weibrecht and Hudec, this time for the Czech Republic and no longer competing for Canada, returned to the Games, but both did not finish here. The second bronze medalist from Sochi, Bode Miller, was by now retired.
The starting order for speed events was changed since the last Olympics. The top 10 racers of the World Cup Starting List (WCSL), beginning with the leader, could choose an odd bib number from 1-19, while the next ten racers from the WCSL could choose an even bib number from 2-20. As expected Jansrud set the pace, when coming down with bib #7 and taking the lead 0.51 seconds ahead of Kriechmayr. Coming down with bib #9 Svindal placed second 31/100ths of a second behind his compatriot, but the Norwegian pair was already blown-up when Blaise Giezendanner, bib #10, claimed second place only 2/10ths of a second behind Jansrud. The Frenchman had not been considered a medal contender as he did not race in the Combined nor in the downhill event and his best Super G finish in a World Cup event ever was an eighth place back in February 2016.
The winner was wearing bib #15 and the win went to Austria, when Matthias Mayer was 18/100ths of a second faster than Jansrud. His win was only in danger when Beat Feuz left the start house next, having already won bronze in the downhill. Feuz finished second, only 0.13 seconds slower, but beat Jansrud by 0.05 second, with Griezendanner fourth and Svindal fifth.
After his downhill gold medal in Sochi, Mayer became the second skier to win the Olympic speed double, only one day after Svindal achieved this by winning the downhill. Mayer won the race with an average speed of 99 km/h and was 3.57 metres ahead of Feuz at the finish. As in the downhill, Head again made a clean sweep of the medals, with the top five finishers using their skis.

Her countrywoman, Anna Fenninger then skied the course 0.66 seconds better than Hosp, giving the Austrians the first two places. Tina Maze (SLO) took over the bronze medal place with a time of 1:26.28, but this was short lived as Lara Gut (SUI) went 0.03 seconds faster.

On her 29th birthday, GÃ¶rgl had bad luck at the start, when she was not able to catch her left pole and lost a tenth of a second on the flat start. But GÃ¶rgl skied well and when she crossed the finish line she took the lead, 0.32 seconds in front of Riesch. With bib number 17 Lindsey Vonn started and, as expected, led at all splits and took the lead by 0.26 seconds. But it would not last long. Andrea Fischbacher (third in the Super G World Cup in 2008-09 and bronze medalist at the 2009 World Championships) with number 19 sped down the course and took the lead by 0.74 seconds at the finish.

Although a bit of a surprise, she had finished second to Vonn in the last World Cup Super G prior the Games.

The silver was also a surprise, going to Russian Svetlana Gladysheva, who was mainly a downhiller, having won a bronze in that event at the 1991 World Championships.

A World Cup Super G was held on this track in March 2017, which was won by Sofia Goggia, with Lindsey Vonn in second, and Ilka Å tuhec, who did not compete at PyeongChang due to an ACL injury to her left knee, in third. The ongoing Super G World Cup saw different winners in all six races with Weirather winning in Lake Louise, Flury in St. Moritz, Vonn (Super G World Cup winner in 2014/15) and Veith in the Val dâIsÃ¨re double, Brignone in Bad Kleinkirchheim and Gut in Cortina dâAmpezzo. Gut, winner of the Super G Crystal Globe in 2013/14 and 2015/16 and the bronze medalist in this event at the 2017 World Championships, topped the current standings. She was followed by Weirather, the 2016/17 Super G World Cup winner and silver medalist from the 2017 Worlds, and Schnarf in third. The reigning World Champion was Nicole Schmidhofer, who had struggled with injuries in the last two seasons, and the gold medalist from Sochi as well as from the 2015 World Championships, Anna Veith, was back for this season. Maria HÃ¶fl-Riesch and Nicole Hosp, the other two medalists from Sochi, had both since retired.
The starting order for speed events was changed since the last Olympics. The top 10 racers of the World Cup Starting List (WCSL), beginning with the leader, could choose an odd bib number from 1-19, while the next ten racers from the WCSL could choose an even bib number from 2-20. Because of the multiple delays with windy conditions, there were no downhill training runs before this race.
The weather was sunny, but still cold at -9Â° C. at the start and the gusty winds were still a factor. After seven racers Weirather was in the lead, just 0.01 seconds ahead of Gut, who was also only another 0.03 seconds ahead of Schnarf. The changing winds meant that not all skiers had the same conditions, but with bib #15 Veith took the lead, 1/10th of a second faster than Weirather. It looked like a fairytale that Veith could win gold after missing almost two seasons due to a multiple ligament right knee injury in October 2015 and another surgery in her left knee due to a chronic inflammation in February 2017.
Ester LedeckÃ¡ in bib #26, however, ended this dream and a new fairytale started. LedeckÃ¡, whose best World Cup Super G result ever at this point was twice 19th, was only 0.01 seconds faster than Veith to win the most surprising Alpine skiing gold at this Games. Her winning speed was 89.21 km/h and at the end LedeckÃ¡ was only 25 cm. ahead of Veith.
LedeckÃ¡, who was already a double snowboarding World Champion, went on to also win gold in the snowboarding parallel giant slalom seven days later to win a unique and unusual double at the Olympics, becoming the first ever woman (summer and winter) to win two gold medals in two different sports at the same Olympics. She was also the first ever Alpine skiing Olympic champion from the Czech Republic, breaking the Austrian domination in this event, who had won the last three titles.
The bronze medal won by Weirather was the first ever Super G medal for Liechtenstein and the first Olympic medal (summer and winter) for this country since Paul Frommelt won bronze in slalom back in 1988. For her win LedeckÃ¡ used Atomic skis loaned to her by Mikaela Shiffrin, who did not participate in this race, while Veith and Weirather skied Head. LedeckÃ¡ also created the most comical press moment at these Games, when she appeared at the press conference wearing her ski goggles. She later explained that she never expected to win a medal and so she was not made up.

Compagnoni would later win gold medals at the 1994 and 1998 Winter Olympics, making her the first Alpine skier to win gold medals in three Olympic Winter Games.

With Russia out of the weightlifting competition at the 2016 Rio Games, one of the favourites for gold, the two-time World and European champion and 2012 Olympic bronze medalist Ruslan Albegov, was also out.
But this was a deeply talented category anyway, with the defending Olympic champion Behdad Salimi of Iran, the 2015 World champion Lasha Talakhadze (promoted to 1st place after Russia Aleksey Lovchev failed a doping test), Mart Seim of Estonia and Armenia Gor Minasyan, the 2015 World silver and bronze medalists respectively.
The lead bounced around in the snatch with Salimi opening at 206 kg, then had a 211 kg snatch. Talakhadze then broke Salimi snatch world record when he lifted 215 kg, only to have Samili re-set it at 216 kg a minute later, and entered the clean & jerk narrowly in the lead by 1 kg, with Talakhadze right behind him.
Salimi, the Olympic champion was desperately trying to defend his title, but could not complete any of his three attempts on the clean & jerk and bombed out. While he disagreed with the judge ruling on his first two attempts, he didnât have the energy to complete the third.
Talakhadze, who had six good lifts on the day, had a clean & jerk lift of 258 kg, 11 kg  more than his second, and it gave him the surprise Olympic title, against what could have been a distracting backdrop.
Security forces were called in after Iranian coaches reacted furiously to Talakhadze win over Salimi where he and the head coach of Iran team, Sajjad Anoushrivani, were yelling, screaming and angrily approaching the jury, claiming there was a conspiracy led by an Iraqi on the jury.
With Talakhadze 473 kg total, he surpassed the 472 kg world record mark of Iranian, Hossein Reza Zadeh, set 16 years ago at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney.
Minasyan finished 22 kg behind Talakhadze and won Armenia third silver medal of the Games, after wrestler Migran Arutyunyan, and weightlifter Simon Martirosyan.

Challenging him would be defending Olympic champion Matthias Steiner of Germany and Ruslan Albegov of Russia, the reigning European Champion. Salimi compatriot Sajjad Anoushiravani was also in the running for a medal as runner-up at the most recent World Championships and bronze medalist at the 2012 Asian Championships and 2010 Asian Games.
In the snatch, Salimi and Albegov both lifted 208 kg and, by virtue of his far lighter body weight, gave the Russian a slight advantage going into the clean and jerk. Only two other competitors managed weights of over 200 kg: Anoushiravani (204 kg) and Irakâli Turmanidze of Georgia (201 kg). Steiner lifted 192 kg on his first lift and then went for 196 kg for his second attempt, but was unsuccessful and, as he dropped the weight, it came down on the back of his neck. Although he was not seriously injured in the accident, he was unable to compete any further and dropped out. In the clean and jerk Anoushiravani took an early lead with a 237 kg lift and was soon followed by Albegov, who lifted 240 kg to take first place. The Iranian responded with a 245 kg lift to retake the gold medal position while Jeon Sang-Gyun of South Korea, 2010 Asian Games runner-up and 2011 world bronze medalist, lifted 246 kg to slide into the final podium spot. Salimi then entered with a successful attempt at 247 kg, enough to give him a six point lead in the competition. Albegov was unable to match this and thus remained in third, albeit a comfortable 12 points head of Jeon, the only remaining competitor who could knock him off the podium. While he was waiting, Anoushiravani tried a 251 kg lift to pass Salimi but was unsuccessful, settling for silver. Jeon returned with the 259 kg attempt he needed to pass Albegov, but failed and was left out of the medals. Salimi, now guaranteed gold, chose 264 kg for his second lift and tried to surpass the world record for the clean and jerk. Unsuccessful, he bowed out of a third attempt and went home an Olympic champion.

Danielyan opened with a world record snatch of 207.5 kg, only to see it broken first by Weller, with 210.0 kg, and then Iran Hossein Reza Zadeh, who lifted 212.5 kg and took the lead. In the snatch Reza Zadeh lifted 260.0 kg for a world record total of 472.5 kg. The others were forced to attempt bigger weights, with Weller and Danielyan missing at 262.5 kg, and Chemerkin not coming close at 272.5 kg. This gave the gold medal to Reza Zadeh, who would return in 2004 and defend his title.
The bronze medal seemed to belong to Danielyan, but he tested positive for stanozolol (an anabolic steroid) and was disqualified, lifting Chemerkin up to the bronze medal position. Weller won the silver medal, his fourth Olympic medal, including a bronze in 1988 and gold in 1992 in heavyweight II. His four Olympic medals made him only the second weightlifter to accomplish this, after American Norb Schemansky (1948-64).

The class was now for lifters over 109 kg bodyweight, the second highest in Olympic history after the 110 kg contested from 1972-92. Going into the final event of the Games, European lifters had not won a gold medal, which was the same scenario as Rio 2016.
As in Rio, it was down to the strongest men to change this, and once again that responsibility fell on the shoulders of the Georgian Lasha Talakhadze. In Rio he had support as the Europeans enjoyed a clean sweep of the medals but this time he was almost alone. Nevertheless, he was one of the safest gold medal bets of the Games. Talakhadze was unbeaten since Rio, and won three world and four European titles, and was also the world record holder with 264 kg in clean & jerk, 222 kg in snatch, and 485 kg in total, with the last two records achieved only in April 2021. The next best lifters in this weight class for the season were Gor Minasyan, silver medallist in the super-heavyweight class in Rio, and his compatriot Varazdat Lalayan. They finished second and third in the last European championships with 464 kg and 445 kg, respectively, but both had not been selected for Tokyo as the Armenian Weightlifting Federation was sanctioned due to the high number of doping offences. Also not present was Fernando Reis, qualification best 436 kg, as he had tested positive for doping shortly before going to Tokyo. So, the best qualified athletes at the Games after Talakhadze were Ali Davoudi, qualification best 441 kg, Man Asaad, season best 433 kg, Walid Bidani, qualification best 431 kg, and Hojamuhammet ToÃ½Ã§yÃ½ew, qualification best 427 kg. Unfortunately, Bidani was not able to participate as he was tested positive for COVID-19 on arrival in Japan and again one day before the competition.
Talakhadze was untouchable, and both in snatch and clean & jerk he started his attempts only when all the other competitors had already finished their lifts. Talakhadze gave a flawless performance, not missing any of his six attempts, and finally set world records in both techniques beating his own snatch, and clean & jerk records by 1 kg each and the total record by 3 kg. Silver was also a safe proposition for Davoudi, who lifted 200 kg and 241 kg for a total of 441 kg. Only the battle for bronze provided a brief challenge as ToÃ½Ã§yÃ½ew tried to lift 241 kg in his last attempt but failed, which secured bronze for Asaad.
The Olympic Standard for Olympic records was 204 kg for snatch, 250 kg for clean & jerk, and 449 kg for total. Talakhadze bettered these records in five of his six lifts which meant that he set eight Olympic records, only his first clean & jerk attempt was not good enough.
Asaad bronze was the first ever Olympic weightlifting medal for Syria, while the fifth place of David Liti was the best ever Olympic weightlifting result for New Zealand.

Ties broken by lightest bodyweight.,na,"Under normal circumstances, Russia Tatyana Kashirina would have been the clear favorite for the women super-heavyweight gold medal at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio. She was a four-time World (2010, 2013-2015) and six-time European (2009-2012, 2014-2015) champion, a two-time World runner-up (2009 and 2011), an Olympic silver medalist (2012), and the world record holder for both portions of the event and the total. Doping concerns, however, saw the entire Russian weightlifting team banned from Rio and left the top podium spot open for the taking. The most likely candidate to claim that honor was China Meng Suping, successor to the defending Olympic champion Zhou Lulu. Zhou had been runner-up at the 2013 Worlds, before Meng took over that role in 2014 and 2015. The only other recent World medalist at the tournament was Kim Kuk-Hyang of North Korea, the 2015 bronze medalist. Three recent European Championship medalists also made an appearance: Andreea Aanei of Romania (bronze in 2014 and 2015), Anastasiya Lysenko of Ukraine (silver in 2015), and Anastâasia Hotâpridi of Georgia (silver in 2016).
Kim posted the best result in the snatch portion, at 131 kg, while Meng, who struggled at first, came up only 1 kg short by the end. These two were head and shoulders above the rest of the competition, with the next best result being 126 kg, posted by Sarah Robles of the United States, an Olympic veteran who placed 7th in 2012. Kim and Meng were even more dominant in the clean and jerk portion, but this time it was the former who struggled more, and Meng managed to defeat the North Korean with a 177 kg lift, 2 kg more than Kim could muster.

Ties broken by lightest bodyweight.,na,"Zhou Lulu of China, the world record holder in total points, reigning World Champion, and silver medalist at the 2011 Asian Championships, was the favorite to take gold in the women super-heavyweight weightlifting event at the 2012 Summer Olympics. Close on her heels was Tatyana Kashirina of Russia, world record holder in the snatch, World Champion in 2010 and runner-up in 2009 and 2011, and European Champion for the last four years. Both would have to contend with Jang Mi-Ran of South Korea who, as the defending Olympic Champion and silver medalist in 2004, held all the Olympic records. Jang was also the 2010 Asian Games Champion and World Champion from 2005 through 2009, although she had strayed somewhat from her peak form since then. Another notable competitor was Ele Opeloge of Samoa who, in 2008, had finished fourth in the event, the highest placement ever for an Olympian representing her nation.
The competition boiled down to an exchange of Olympic and World records between Zhou and Kashirina. Zhou first set an Olympic record with 142 kg, followed by Kashirina 144 kg lift, then Zhou 146 kg attempt (which took two tries). The Russian then used her next two turns to reset her own world record twice â first with 149 kg, then with 151 kg. By the end of the snatch both were untouchable, as the next highest lift came from Mariam Usman of Nigeria, 2008 African Champion and bronze medalist at the most recent World Championships, and it was only 129 kg. The clean and jerk portion played out similarly: Zhou set an Olympic record for total lift and Kashirina bested it by setting a world record of 332. Zhou then set an Olympic record in the clean and jerk with a 187 kg lift and upped the world record for total points to 333. The Russian was unable to respond and remained in second place, with Zhou still having one lift remaining. Now guaranteed gold, Zhou attempted 190 kg, more than sufficient to set a world record in the clean and jerk, but was unsuccessful. Meanwhile, after Usman was unable to lift 160 kg in three attempts, therefore failing to post a score, the bronze medal went to Hripsime Khurshudyan of Armenia, who had been fourth in the snatch and lifted the highest total, after Zhou and Kashirina, in the clean and jerk with 166 kg. Khurshudyan was normally a heavyweight competitor, the division in which she earned a world bronze medal in 2009, and had a slew of European medals, including bronze in 2010, silver in 2006, 2009, and 2011 (in the super-heavyweight), and gold in 2007.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected. Every women weightlifting event at the 2012 London Olympics, except flyweight (â¤ 48 kg), was affected by positive re-tests.
In November 2016 original bronze medalist Hripsime Khurshudyan (ARM) tested positive for turinabol (dehydrochloromethyltestosterone) and stanozolol, was disqualified, and lost her bronze medal, which was re-assigned to Korea Jang Mi-Ran. Khurshudyan re-tested sample from the 2008 Beijing Olympics was also positive for stanozolol and she was disqualified in that event as well.

Ties broken by lightest bodyweight.,na,"Just a few hours after the women heavyweight competition, the final women weightlifting event in Tokyo was contested and was the super-heavyweight class for lifters with a bodyweight of more than 87 kg.
The clear favourite was Li Wenwen, the reigning world champion from 2019 and back-to-back winner of the last two Asian championships in 2019 and 2020 (held in 2021). At the last Asian championships four months before the Olympics, she set world records in snatch (148 kg), clean & jerk (187 kg), and total (335 kg). The only other athlete to set a world record in this class was Tatyana Kashirina, but she was suspended after anti-doping investigations in December 2020. The best qualifiers were Sarah Robles, qualification best 290 kg, Laurel Hubbard, qualification best 285 kg, VerÃ³nica SaladÃ­n, qualification best 283 kg, Lee Seon-Mi, qualification best 280 kg, and Emily Campbell, season best 276 kg. Not present was Son Yeong-Hui, the silver medallist at the last Asian championships with 279 kg.
A controversy was the participation of Hubbard who was the first ever openly transgender athlete competing at the Olympics. She lived as a man until 2012 when she underwent a gender reassignment surgery; still it was argued that she was born in a men body and went through male puberty, but she fulfilled all requirements including a low testosterone level. The IOC had already allowed transgender athletes at the Olympics since 2004, but Hubbard was the first to compete, which was seen as an important step for more inclusion at the Games not only by the LGBT community.
The competition was easily won by Li who started her snatch, as well as her clean & jerk, after all other athletes had already finished their lifts. She enjoyed a perfect competition as she cleared all six attempts, finishing with a total of 320 kg and a winning margin of 37 kg. The battle for the other medals was closer as Robles lifted 128 kg, Lee 125 kg, and Campbell 122 kg in snatch, while Hubbard failed to give a valid lift. In clean & jerk, Lee started with 148 kg while Robles and Campbell lifted 150 kg each. Lee went on to 152 kg, which was answered with a 154 kg by Robles, and when Lee missed 155 kg, and Campbell cleared 156 kg, the Korean was out of the medals. Robles was not able to improve, but Campbell also cleared another personal best with 161 kg to secure silver.
The Olympic Standard for Olympic records was 139 kg for snatch, 172 kg for clean & jerk, and 306 kg for total. All records were broken by Li who managed to lift 140 kg in snatch, and 173 and 180 kg in clean & jerk, for totals of 313 and 320 kg. After Li Fabin and Chen Lijun both won weightlifting gold for China on the same day earlier in this Games, Wang Zhouyu and Li did the same for their native country for a total of seven weightlifting gold medal for China at these Games, a mark only once achieved previously by the Soviet Union in 1976.
Despite failing to show a valid lift, Hubbard became the oldest female weightlifter ever to compete at the Olympics aged 43 years 174 days, surpassing Maria Elisabete Jorge who was only 24 days younger when she participated back in 2000. Overall, Hubbard was the third oldest weightlifting competitor ever, male or female, with only Josef Schuster and Adelfino Mancinelli, who both competed in 1952, being older. Kuinini Manumua was the first ever female weightlifter from Tonga to compete at the Olympics and finished eighth. Tenth place finisher Sarah Fischer was the first ever female lifter from Austria at the Olympics.

MusuÄ¾bes had not been chosen for the 2004 Olympic team so left the Russian squad and began competing for Slovakia, as he did in Beijing. The match between the last two gold medalists was very close, but Taymazov prevailed, winning the first two periods 1-0. In the final Taymazov faced Russian Bakhtiyar Akhmedov, also shutting him in and winning in two straight periods. Taymazov would return in 2012 and win his third consecutive gold medal in this class. MusuÄ¾bes held on and won a bronze medal in Beijing, along with Kazakh Marid Mutalimov.

In April 2017, Artur Taymazov (UZB) was revealed to have a positive test for turinabol (dehydrochloromethyltestosterone) and stanozolol, and was disqualified, tentatively losing his gold medal.

Competitors losing to the finalists entered repechage tournament for bronze medals.,na,"Since his first appearance at the Olympic Games in 2000, Artur Taymazov of Uzbekistan had reached the finals of the men super-heavyweight freestyle wrestling tournament every time and had lost only once, in his first attempt. He was also a two time World Champion (2003 and 2006) and runner-up (2001 and 2010), twice Asian Champion (2000 and 2011), and three-time Asian Games gold medalist (2002, 2006, and 2010). Nonetheless he was expected to have some significant challengers at the 2012 Summer Olympics, most notably Bilyal Makhov of Russia, a three-time (2007, 2009, 2010) World Champion and 2010 European Champion. Makhov lost his world title in 2011 to Aleksey Shemarov of Belarus, however, who would also be looking to challenge Taymazov in the final. Not to be counted out was Taha AkgÃ¼l of Turkey, the reigning European Champion.
Taymazov was drawn into a relatively easy half that included Shemarov, who was defeated by Tervel Dlagnev of the United States, the 2011 Pan American Champion. Taymazov pinned Dlagnev in the semi-finals and went on to meet Davit Modzmanashvili of Georgia in the gold medal match. Modzmanashvili was a bronze medalist at the most recent World and European Championships who had returned from a doping violation in 2008 and defeated Bilyal Makhov in the semi-finals of the London tournament. In the final, Taymazov proved himself once again to be worthy of Olympic Gold, winning the first round par terre by successfully reversing Modzmanashvili advantage and pushing the Georgian out of the ring in the second period for an unanswered point that earned him the Olympic crown.
The first bronze medal match pitted Dlagnev against Komeil Ghasemi of Iran, runner up to Taymazov at the most recent Asian Championships. Ghasemi wasted no time in the first period, winning it within the first 20 seconds by scoring four points that would remain unanswered. The second period went to par terre, where the American drew the advantage and converted it into a point, but the Iranian was able to push his opponent out of the ring in the final ten seconds of the last round to earn the bronze. The final podium spot was decided between Makhov and Daulet Shabanbay of Kazakhstan, who had won his first his first major international medal at the age of 14 in the heavyweight division of the 2008 Asian Championships and repeated the feat in 2009 and 2011 before moving up to the super-heavyweight class. Makhov experience was on display in the first period, scoring five unanswered points, but Shabanbay responded in the second round with a three-point shutout of his own. In the final period, the three-time World Champion was simply the better wrestler, and won the medal with a 3-0 score.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected.
The original silver medalist, Davit Modzanashvili of Georgia, was later disqualified when he was revealed to have a re-test positive for both dehydrochloromethyltestosterone (turinabol) and stanozolol. His silver medal was removed. In July 2019, the gold medalist, Artur Taymazov of Uzbekistan was similarly disqualified when a re-test of his doping sample showed evidence of dehydrochloromethyltestosterone (turinabol) metabolites. In February 2020, the IOC ruled on the final standings and medals and awarded gold medals to both Ghasemi and Makhov, while Dlagnev and Shabanbay became the bronze medalists. Dlagnev received his bronze medal on 6 March 2022 at the 2022 Big 10 Conference Wrestling Championships.

AkgÃ¼l beat Mongolia Jargalsaikhany Chuluunbat, and Ibragim Saidov of Belarus en route to the final, while Komeil Ghasemi, the other 2012 Olympic bronze medalist, earned a decision win over the American Tervel Dlagnev to wrestle AkgÃ¼l again for gold.

The bronze medals went to Lithuania Mindaugas Mizgaitis and Armenia Yury Patrikeyev. Patrikeyev was actually Russian and had been 2002 and 2004 European Champion, but was bypassed for the 2004 Olympics in favor of Baroyev, so Patrikeyev left the Russian team and started competing for Armenia in 2005.

They were both in London, but were only two among a host of other strong entrants who were seen as unlikely to challenge LÃ³pez for the crown.
LÃ³pez powered through the tournament, which included defeating Kayaalp in the semi-finals. Baroyev, meanwhile, was conquered in his first match and, when the dust of the tournament had settled, Heiki Nabi of Estonia stood to challenge LÃ³pez for gold. Nabi had been a heavyweight wrestler throughout his career, winning the 2006 World Championship in the division, but had switched to the super-heavyweight category to compete in his first Olympics. In the end, however, it was LÃ³pez experience and raw power that won the day, making the most of his top advantage in the first-round par terre and successfully defending against both a gut-wrench and a challenge to his Olympic title in the second.
In the first bronze medal match, Kayaalp easily defeated Guram Pherselidze of Georgia, pushing him out of the ring in two rounds and claiming a podium spot. In the contest for the other bronze medal, Belarusâ Iosif Chugoshvili and Sweden Johan EurÃ©n, a bronze medalist from the 2010 European Championships, were evenly matched. The first two rounds went to par terre, where each wrestler was successful in their defense, which left the final podium spot up to a final, decisive two minutes. With neither competitor able to score in the first 90 seconds, and with points and cautions tied, a ball was drawn to determine who would choose the positions in the final par terre.

En route to the final round, LÃ³pez and Kayaalp dominated each of their first three Olympic matches with both not allowing an opponent a single point on them. All three of Kayaalp preliminary matches ended earlier than the allotted time â two were won by technical fall, and one by him pinning his opponent just after the first minute.

Aisen and Yuan were top scorers after each of the first three dives, by which time the British pair were more than 15 points adrift, but then disaster struck for the Chinese duo and they dropped 20 points on dive four as Daley and Lee took the lead by just over five points. They held that lead going into the final dive, but what a slender lead it was, as Aisen and Yuan pulled back 3.48 points to trail by just 1.74. Out of the two pairs, it was the British duo who dived first in the final round and what a time to put in their best performance, as they recorded 101.01 after a wonderfully executed forward four-and-a-half somersault, the first score of more than 100 in the competition.
To win, Aisen and Yuan had to score 102.76 or more.

Since teaming up, Daley and Goodfellow had finished third in the 2016 World Cup and were silver medalists at the European Championships. The pair had podium finishes in all synchronised events they contested leading up to the Olympics in 2016, and were considered medal candidates in Rio, but to capture gold, the British pair, and the other six pairs, would have to be at their very best to beat the Chinese pair of Chen Aisen and Lin Yue, the 2015 World Champions and 2016 World Cup winners. As it turned out, the Chinese duo were so outstanding that, after the first dive, they took the lead and never lost it, winning by 39.87 points, helped by a wonderful fifth dive which saw them score 106.56 points. In total they received five maximums.
After two dives it was clear that the United States were going to be the nearest challengers, but it was a close battle between Great Britain, Germany, Mexico, Ukraine and Russia for the bronze medal. After three dives, only a couple of points separated those five countries. Germany moved into third place after round four while Britain slipped to fifth place, but they moved back to third after their penultimate dive when they emulated the dive that netted Chen and Lin their 106.56 and, whilst not to the same high standard of the Chinese duo, Daley and Goodfellow managed 92.13. With one round to go, and the last to dive, the British pair knew what they had to do to take bronze and they did it with over six points to spare. There was only one team in it from the start, however, and Lin Yue added another gold to the one he won in the synchronised 3-metre event at Beijing in 2008.

Final round only.,na,"Chen Ruolin won the Olympic title in 2008 and 2012 with different partners and was hoping to make it a unique treble by winning it with yet another partner, Liu Huixia, the 2014 FINA Female Diver of the Year. They teamed up after the 2012 London Olympics and had won all 17 events they subsequently entered, including the 2013 and 2015 World Championship and the World Cup in 2014 and 2016. Any threat to China domination of this event, which has seen them win all four Olympic golds since it was first held in 2000, was probably going to come from the strong Canadian duo of Meaghan Benfeito and Roseline Filion, bronze medalists in London 2012 and silver medalists behind Huixia and Ruolin in the Worlds in both 2013 and 2015. This was their third Olympics together.
True to form, and like their male counterparts the night before, the Chinese pair led from start to finish to win gold, but one thing was different from the men win - the girls were diving into green water! Mysteriously the colour of the water changed from clear blue to green overnight and as the competition progressed it got darker and murkier, but it did not put the competitors off and the event was not disrupted.
The threat to the Chinese did indeed come from the Canadian pair, and also the Malaysia duo of Cheong Jun Hoong and Pandela Rinong, who tied second place with the Canadians after the first two rounds and then pulled away on their own after round three when the North Koreans Kim Kuk-Hyang and Kim Mi-Rae dived into the bronze medal position with the best dive of the round. Going into the final round Great Britain had moved up to fourth place ahead of the Canadians after their best dive, but it all changed in the final round. The Chinese pair saved their best dive for last, scoring 87.36 and guaranteeing first place, while the Malyasian duo also had their best dive of the night to get silver, and Malaysia first of the Games. It was also a second medal for Pandelela Rinong to add to the individual bronze she won in the 10-metre platform event in 2012. The bronze was still to be won and poor 60+ point dives by the Korean and British girls allowed the Canadians to leapfrog them into third place with a score of 80.64 on their final dive.
For China it was continued domination of the event and, in all synchronised women events, they had won nine of the 10 golds since inception in 2000. For Chen Roulin it was a personal milestone as she became only the second diver, make or female, after team-mate Wu Minxia two days earlier, to win a record five Olympic gold medals as she continued her amazing run of winning every major synchronised 10-metre title since 2006.

At the Tokyo Aquatics Centre, they soon showed they were going to be a force to be reckoned with and led from the start and produced one stunning dive after another. They were top scorers after every dive and won the gold medal by a massive 52.98 points from the American pair of Jessica Parratto and Delaney Schnell, with the Mexicans Gabriela AgÃºndez and Alejandra Orozco in the bronze medal position. After two dives the Mexicans were lying sixth and seventh respectively, and the Mexican duo only snatched the bronze medal with their last dive from Matsuri Arai and Minami Itahashi of Japan, who dropped from third to sixth
Canada Meaghan Benfeito and Caeli McKay, who won the Diving World Cup at the Tokyo Aquatics Centre earlier in 2021, finished fourth, but were in a medal position after three rounds until a bad fourth round cost them dearly. They were attempting the toughest dive of the day, a back three-and-a-half somersaults, but it netted them only 51.48 points, the lowest score of the round. They made some ground on the Mexicans with their final dive but lost out on the bronze by just 0.54 points, and with it went Benfeito chance of winning a medal at three successive Games.
There was even bigger disappointment for Malaysia 2019 World Championships silver medallists, Leong Mun Yee and her partner Pandelela Rinong (who won silver in Rio), as they finished eighth and last in the fifth Olympics for each of them. After their first dive, however, they were just three points behind the Chinese duo and after two dives were still in a medal position, but a disastrous third dive saw them drop to seventh, from which they never recovered. Like Canada Meaghan Benfeito, Rinong also missed out on a third consecutive medal.

Now, Laugher and his new partner Daniel Goodfellow were looking for a repeat success.
At the 2019 World Championships, the British duo finished second to China Cao Yuan and Xie Siyi. In Tokyo, Siyi had a new partner, Wang Zongyuan, and they were looking to win back the only diving gold medal China failed to win in Rio. Germany had medal candidates in Lars Rudiger and opening ceremony flagbearer Patrick Hausding, the 2016 individual springboard bronze medallist now in his fourth Olympics.
The Chinese pair were outstanding from the outset of the competition, and after the first dives led by 4.20 points from Japan, with the defending champion Laugher struggling in last place. In the second round the Chinese favourites scored three maximum 10s on their reverse dive as they increased their lead.
The United States overtook Japan into the silver medal position after dive number three and Mike Hixon, silver medalist at Rio, and new partner Andrew Capobianco stayed in second place throughout the rest of the competition. The bronze medal was not decided until the very last dive when Germany Hausding and Rudiger edged out the Mexican pair thanks to pulling off a difficult tucked forward 4.5 somersault, and their score of 85.50 won the bronze by 4.59 points. For Hauding, it was his third Olympic medal to go with the springboard individual in Rio and platform synchronised event at Beijing 2008.
Laugher and Goodfellow struggled with each dive and could only finish seventh, 85 points behind the Chinese pair, despite the second highest scoring dive in the final round. Only the ROC (who were joint second after two dives) finished lower than Great Britain as Yevgeny Kuznetsov and Nikita Shleykher recorded the first foul dive at the Olympics since Athina 2004 when China Peng Bo and Wang Kenan produced a zero score, also in the springboard synchronised event.

Six dives. Final round only.,na,"Since its launch at the 2000 Olympics, China has won three of the four men synchronized springboard gold medals and Qin Kai was hoping for a third consecutive gold medal with Cao Yuan, with whom he won the 2015 world title. Qin had an outstanding record in springboard diving, particularly the synchronised event. He was the individual silver medalist at London in 2012 and was the synchronised gold medalist in 2008 and 2012 and the gold medal winner at all five biennial World Championships between 2007-15. He came to the Games with an impressive string of results in 2016, having won the synchronised title at all three World Series events in Windsor (Canada), Dubai and Beijing. On each occasion he was partnered by Cao Yuan and it was difficult to see gold going anywhere other than to those two. Cao was a 10-metres synchronised gold medalist in 2012, but did not defend his title, entering the 3-metre event instead. The only serious threat to the Chinese divers seemed to be coming from the Russians Ilya Zakharov and Yevgeny Kuznetsov, runners-up in London 2012 and second to Kai and Yuan at the 2015 World Championship, where the British pair Jack Laugher and Chris Mears won bronze.
The water in the pool was still the murky green colour it had mysteriously become, but it did not bother Kai and Yuan. It looked as though the Chinese clean sweep of diving golds would continue after the first two rounds when they led from Laugher and Mears and the American duo Sam Dorman and Mike Hixon. Round three saw the fancied Russians fall further behind after a bad dive and, unusually, the same happened to the Chinese pair as the British lads dived into the lead ahead of China and the United States.
The fourth round saw heavy rain blowing across the board but the America pair were not affected as they went ahead of China and into the silver medal position. The fifth series of dives saw the Chinese pair back into second place while the British duo held on to a 2.64 point lead. Another disastrous round by the Russians, who registered only 63.00 points, saw the 2012 silver medalists out of contention.
The fifth round was shrouded with controversy. The Germans had dived first and their 81.60 temporarily put them in the lead. Next to go were the Mexican divers Jahir Ocampo and Rommel Pacheco. They just set off on their dive as the stadium lights came on and they completed their dive but insisted the lights had put them off and a re-dive was ordered so they climbed up to the board to take their dive again. At poolside, however, discussions were taking place and it was decided not to allow them a re-dive and they were called back down and after an eight-minute delay the Americans were next to dive. Fortunately the delay did not affect them as they scored a competition best 98.04 and become the new leaders. Great Britain and China, however, still had to dive.
Laugher and Mears put in a great dive and knew that more than 88 points would put them in the lead, which they did with a 91.20. Now only the Chinese could deprive them of gold but, by their normal high standards, Yuan and Kai only managed 83.22 and had to be content with bronze, as Great Britain won its first ever Olympic diving gold, the pair from the Leeds diving club adding this title to the European and Commonwealth ones they already held. For Mears the win had a far reaching significance because he faced life-saving surgery to have his spleen removed in 2009 and spent time in a coma. For China that dream of a clean sweep of medals was over.

In the final Meijers and Tommaselli faced a French team of Jean-Baptiste Louvet and probably the strongest sprinter in the event, Edmond Jacquelin. In the sprint, the team of Anton Huber of Germany and Franz Seidl of Austria led out, but Meijers and Tommaselli were too strong and came around them to win the final narrowly, as Louvet and Jacquelin did not contest the last 100 metres as they were well back.

Their team consisted of Natalie Geisenberger, the doubles pair of Tobias Arlt and Tobias Wendl, and Johannes Ludwig. All the German sliders had won their individual or doubles events earlier in the Beijing Games, making them clear favourites in the mixed relay.
Germany swept the luge gold medals in Beijing, something that has been achieved four times before, and all were by German teams. The German Democratic Republic did so in 1976 and 1988, and Germany in 1998 and 2014. Only the 2014 Germany sweep was over four events as opposed to three in the other years, as the mixed team relay was added to that year Olympic programme.
The German team was very experienced as all four sliders grew up training together. Geisenberger, Arlt, and Wendl were 34-years-old, while Ludwig was almost 36. Ludwig became the oldest gold medallist in this event at 35 years, 361 days. He was the second oldest gold medallist in any luge event, after Sylke Otto in 2006 women singles, who was 36 years, 221 days
Geisenberger and Wendl/Arlt won their third gold medals in the event, while Ludwig won his second, as the German team was the same foursome that won gold in 2018. Arlt, Wendl and Geisenberger all won their sixth luge gold medals, the best ever for Olympic luge sliders. This also puts all three in a tie for fifth place for most gold medals at the Olympic Winter Games. Geisenberger then became Germany most successful winter Olympian with six gold and one bronze in total.
The German victory was much closer than expected, as their margin over the second-placed Austrian team was only 0.08 seconds, and Germany trailed for much of the relay, with only Arlt and Wendl pulling ahead on their run.

Unfortunately, the double couldnât keep pace and Russia finished seventh.
Latvia was up next, but their singles were not at the level of four years earlier, and even with the Å ics-brothers in the double they placed sixth.

The Germans started with Natalie Geisenberger setting the fastest time of the day for the women. Jo Ludwig made a safe run but they were still about 2/10ths ahead of Canada when the double went off.

Each luger hit a touchpad at the end of their run, which then released a gate at the top of the course for the next luger to start their run and total time determining the winning team. As Germany had already won the individual and doubles events, the main question appeared to be who would take the minor medals.
Of the more favoured teams, Latvia set the early pace with a combined time of 2:47.295. This was immediately bettered by the host nation Russia who completed the course in a time of 2:46.679 and took over the lead. The United States and Italy then went down the course, but failed to dislodge the top two. Germany, using all their gold medallists, went on to post the best time of 2:45.649, over a second ahead of second placed Russia and completing a clean sweep of luge gold medals. Canada, starting next-to-last, briefly threatened to take the bronze medal, but eventually finished 0.1 seconds behind Latvia. With the German victory, Natalie Geisenberger became the first woman to win two luge gold medals at the same games.
The coach of the 4th place Canadian team was unhappy at what he believed were suspicious changes in track temperature during the event. The official data revealed that the track temperature rose by a degree between the runs of the 1st set of teams (which included Russia), and the higher ranking 2nd set of 5 teams, despite the air temperature falling by the same margin. When challenged to make an official protest over the incident, the Canadians declined.
In May 2016 WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) commissioned a report, the McLaren Report, to look into allegations of systematic Russian doping and a cover-up to avoid positives at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. The report was released in two parts, in July and December 2016, and confirmed the allegations. In 2017 the IOC formed a commission to investigate this, headed by IOC Member Denis Oswald, and usually referred to as the Oswald Commission. In late October 2017 the Oswald Commission began to release its findings.
On 22 December 2017 Albert Demchenko and Tatyana Ivanova were disqualified as a result of the Oswald Commission findings, which disqualified the silver medal winning Russian team. They immediately appealed this decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), and about 10 days before the PyeongChang Winter Olympics began, the CAS reached a decision and both athletes were exonerated and the Russian silver medal was restored.

On the final leg, Germany was marginally ahead of Finland with Russia close behind, racing abreast up the final hill and down towards the final turn and into the stadium. It looked as if the leading group of Tscharnke, Finland Sami JauhojÃ¤rvi and Russia Nikita Kryukov would be fighting for the medals, when JauhojÃ¤rvi, just ahead of Tscharnke, moved to the inside, colliding with the German, and Tscharnke fell, almost bringing down Kryukov. JauhojÃ¤rvi opened up a small lead which he maintained to the end of the race, finishing just under a second ahead of the fast finishing Russian. Tscharnke was unable to recover quickly enough and eventually finished seventh. Finland had to withstand an appeal from Germany before Iivo Niskanen and JauhojÃ¤rvi could enjoy their victory. Sweden benefitted from the accident, taking bronze.
In May 2016 WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) commissioned a report, the McLaren Report, to look into allegations of systematic Russian doping and a cover-up to avoid positives at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. The report was released in two parts, in July and December 2016, and confirmed the allegations. In 2017 the IOC formed a commission to investigate this, headed by IOC Member Denis Oswald, and usually referred to as the Oswald Commission. In late October 2017 the Oswald Commission began to release its findings. On 9 November 2017, one of the silver medalists in this event, Russian Maksim Vylegzhanin, was implicated by the Oswald Commission and he and his teammate, Nikita Kryukov were disqualified, losing their silver medal. About 10 days before the PyeongChang Winter Olympics began, the CAS reached a decision, stating that Veglyzhanin guilt could not be proven, and he and Kryukov had their medal restored.

Silver went to the Swedish pair of Maja Dahlqvist and Jonna Sundling, who took gold and silver in the women individual sprint and went into the team final as favorites. Bronze was claimed by the Russian Olympic Committee team with Yuliya Stupak and Nataliya Nepryayeva.
In bright sunshine and a freezing cold temperature of -16.7Â° C, Hennig and Carl had previously won their semi-final and thus qualified directly for the final, beating the USA and Austria. Carl had replaced Katherine Sauerbrey, who was originally nominated but did not feel quite fit. The second semi-final went to the ROC, followed by Finland and Sweden.
As expected, the field stayed close together on the opening laps. On the fourth leg, Sweden Sundling increased the pace at the front and, along with Diggins, created a small gap. Carl could not quite follow and handed over almost four seconds behind. Hennig, however, was able to re-establish contact with the leaders. She attacked with Finland Kerttu Niskanen and tried to outdistance the chasers. Carl went into the final lap with a minimal lead of 0.17, but on the first climb, the first five closed ranks again. Carl ran the last bend in third place, but had the outside lane and pushed past the opposition. She had the most reserves in the final sprint and was the first to cross the line. It was also a birthday present for their coach Peter Schlickenrieder, who won silver at the 2002 Olympic Winter Games exactly 20 years ago, and turned 52 on the day of the Beijing event.

They had to qualify in two heats with 14 teams in each. The first two from each heat, plus another six fastest teams advanced to the final. Maybe the biggest surprise in this round was the failing of the Swiss team that contained 15 km gold medalist Dario Cologna.
The heavily favored Norwegian team of Johannes HÃ¸sflot KlÃ¦bo, already a double gold medalist in PyeongChang, and Martin Johnsrud Sundby, did not waste any energy in both rounds. Then, in the fourth round, things really went off, when all of a sudden KlÃ¦bo, lying second to Aleksandr Bolshunov, started his attack and nobody followed him immediately. Even though in the next leg, the pack led by Denis Spitsov from the OAR team, and Sweden Marcus Hellner, almost close the gap, but Sundby maintained an extremely high pace and eventually increased the lead, when he passed on to KlÃ¦bo for his last round. On the last leg, KlÃ¦bo made it clear the he was not willing to give the others any chance of fighting for gold. Three teams, OAR, Sweden and France then battled for the other two medal places with Bolshunov holding on to second place for the OAR, but had a hard time defending it against Richard Jouve of Fance on the last stretch in the stadium. A rather exhausted Calle Halfvarsson continued Sweden non-medal streak with a fourth place.
The victory of Sundby and KlÃ¦bo in the men team sprint did not come as a surprise, like the gold of the US team in the women event on the same day. The Olympic Athletes from Russia confirmed their excellent performances in the previous races, although the athletes that won the last World title were banned from the Games.

The Swedish team consisted of skiathlon gold medalist Charlotte Kalla, and Stina Nilsson winner of the individual sprint. The Olympic Athletes from Russia and the United States team of Kikkan Randall und Jessie Diggins were considered potential bronze medalists.
The first semi-final was dominated by Norway; Switzerland, Slovenia and Germany also advanced to the final. The second semi-final was hard-fought with the United States being the eventual winners beating Sweden into second, and another four teams - OAR, Finland, Poland and France â qualified as the fastest losers. In the final, Norway, Sweden, United States, and the Olympic Athletes from Russia dictated the first part of the race. Then, Diggins increased the pace and broke away together with Sweden and Norway. The Swiss and the Russians, after a fall and a broken ski pole, both lost contact.
The race was decided on the last of six 1.2 km legs, when Falla led the trio into the last descent. Falla, and the second-placed Nilsson, made physical contact and became unbalanced, but both managed to stay on their feet. Coming out of the descent, Nilsson looked like a sure winner, but an extremely strong Diggins passed Falla and closed the gap on Nilsson. Coming out of the slipstream, the American rose to the occasion and beat Nilsson by 0.2 seconds. Falla just made sure to secure the bronze medal for Norway.

The Dutch were regarded as Britain biggest rivals, having won the team sprint gold medal at the last three UCI World Championships.
The reigning world record holders Netherlands set a new Olympic record 42.134 in qualifying with Team GB second, 0.97 behind, despite being up on their rivals after two or the three laps. The Netherlands trio consisted of Roy van den Berg, Harrie Lavreysen and Matthijs BÃ¼chli, while the British trio was made up of Ryan Owens, Jack Carlin, and Jason Kenny.
In their first-round heat Britain beat Germany with a time of 41.829 while Netherlands qualified fastest after beating Poland in another Olympic record 41.431 and, as the two fastest heat winners, Great Britain and Netherlands met for the gold medal while the two slowest, Australia and France went head-to-head for the bronze medal, which the Europeans won by 1.682 seconds. Day two on the track was also a double blow for Jason Kenny and his wife Laura, who both ended up winning silver on the same day.
Despite leading at the end of the first lap, the British trio were beaten by over three seconds as the Dutch trio of van den Berg, Lavreysen, and Jeffrey Hoogland, in for BÃ¼chli, won in a yet another Olympic record 41.369. The victory ended an 85-year wait for a male track gold medal for the Netherlands, with Arie Van Vliet being their last champion at Berlin in 1936, and in taking the Olympic title, Netherlands became the first reigning world champions since France in 2000 to also collect Olympic gold. Also, it was the first time the Dutch had won a team sprint medal of any colour.

That honor was usually carried by the Germans and the French and all members of both teams, except for France MichaÃ«l DâAlmeida, had at least one World Championship victory to their credit. The defending World Champion, however, was Australia, and all three members of the team Matthew Glaetzer, Shane Perkins, and Scott Sunderland, were in London in hopes of capturing the Olympic title.
The qualification round was blazing, with Russia, France, and Great Britain setting consecutive Olympic records, although the British got off to a poor start when Hindes experienced an equipment malfunction and fell while coming out of the start, thus necessitating a restart. The pace did not slow in the semi-finals, where France set an Olympic record one heat prior to Britain capturing a world record. This left these two nations to race for gold while Germany and Australia dueled for bronze. In the final France nearly kept pace with the Britions through the first lap, but the stronger members of the team quickly widened the gap and made themselves untouchable, winning gold with a world record of exactly 42.6 seconds. Hoy gold medal tied him with British rower Steven Redgrave for the most Olympic victories; he had previously won the 1km time trial in 2004 and the sprint, team sprint, and Keirin events in 2008. His team sprint silver from 2000 also meant that he had tied the record for the most Olympic medals in track cycling. In the bronze medal match, Germany defeated the reigning World Champions, leaving the top four spots in the event looking exactly as they had four years ago.
The British victory, however, was not without controversy. Following the win, Hindes admitted that his crash in the first round was deliberate, part of the team strategy for bad starts. He had also been in danger of being passed by Kenny, which would have resulted in disqualification. Hindes later retracted his statement while British Cycling noted that, as a non-native English speaker, Hindes has simply misspoken. Both the International Olympic Committee and the International Cycling Union declined to investigate and the French did not initiate a complaint, believing the tactic to be within the rules, if not in good sportsmanship.

It was a new addition to the Olympic Games but featured in the UCI Track Cycling World Championships where, for three of the past four years, it was dominated by Australians Kaarle McCulloch and Anna Meares. Their only loss had come in the most recent edition, when the Germans Kristina Vogel and Miriam Welte burst onto the scene and stole the title, twice setting a world record during the event. The British team of Vicki Pendleton and Jessica Varnish, as well as the Chinese team Gong Jinjie and Guo Shuang, were considered to be strong competitors as well, although many believed that the gold medal match would come to a showdown between the Germans and the Australians.
Unfortunately, the event dÃ©but at the Olympics bordered on disastrous. It began with a fairly auspicious start, with Great Britain setting a world record in the qualification round that was almost immediately broken by the Chinese. In the semi-finals, however, Great Britain won their heat with the second fastest time in the round, thus allowing them the opportunity to compete for gold, but lost the chance when they were relegated for an early exchange â Pendleton passed Varnish too early â disqualifying them from the competition. Australia won its heat, but only posted the third-fastest time (even after Britain relegation) and were left to contest bronze against Ukraine. China seemed to be the only team that fared well in this round, once again setting a world record, but met the same fate as the British in the semis. Even though the Chinese team earned gold in their race against Germany, they were relegated to silver for an early exchange of their own. Australia, meanwhile, easily won its match and took home bronze, but seemed somewhat disheartened at the missed opportunity to take the inaugural Olympic title.

But at the 2009 World Championships, Lodwick had won the normal hill and mass start events, with Demong winning the large hill event. Spillane was a former world champion, having won on the large hill in 2003. They likely would have won the 2009 team event at the Worlds, except that Demong was disqualified for forgetting to wear his bib in the jump.
Finland led the jumping, with the United States second, Austria third, and Japan fourth, but the Finnish skiers were not strong in cross-country, were not considered contenders for the gold medal, and they would drop back to seventh overall. The team event ski run began during a light snowstorm that increased in intensity throughout the race. The United States led after two legs of the run, but on the third leg, Austria Felix Gottwald put his team into a narrow lead over the Americans. On the final leg Austrian Mario Stecher and American Demong fought it out, exchanging the lead several times, but Stecher pulled away near the end to bring Austria the gold medal. Austria had the best overall ski time, followed by Germany, which pulled up for the bronze medal.

Olympic equestrian dressage eligibility rules in 1948 required that all competitors be military officers, but after the Games it was discovered that one Swedish team member, GehnÃ¤ll Persson, had been promoted from non-commissioned officer to second lieutenant only for the duration of the Olympic Games to allow him to compete. France Georges Hector, secretary-general of the FÃ©dÃ©ration Ãquestre Internationale (FEI), found this out shortly after the Olympics and it was reported to the IOC Session in April 1949. The IOC deferred the matter back to the FEI, who decided to disqualify Persson. The Swedish Olympic Committee reported in December 1949 that they had returned the medals and diplomas won by the Swedish riders.
The irony was that in November 1949, at the FEI Congress, they relaxed the rules for future Olympic Games, allowing civilians, non-commissioned officers, and even women (in some disciplines, including dressage), to compete.
The Swedish team consisted of Persson, Gustaf Adolf Boltenstern, Jr., and Henri Saint Cyr. As a team, they would return in 1952 and win the gold medal, after the eligibility rules were relaxed, and they would win again in 1956 at Melbourne. Thus, save for the disqualification in 1948, this same threesome would have won the team dressage gold medal at three consecutive Olympics.
After the Swedish disqualification, France was promoted to the gold medal, with the United Statesâ team receiving the silver medals. Bronze went to Portugal, which remains, through 2012, the only medal won by Portugal in Olympic dressage. There were only five teams entered in the competition, with Argentina placing fourth after the Swedish DQ.

The event was contested as a parallel slalom with one jump at halfway. Although named parallel slalom, giant slalom gates were used for this event and skiiers created a specific kind of cross-blocking technique, using both arms to knock down the gates.
Every round saw four duels with two women and two men racing each other head-to-head, with each winner scoring a point for the team. For a tied race both nations were awarded a point and, if both racers did not finish, the skier who progressed further was awarded a point. The most number of wins decided the team winner in a single-elimination tournament. If the score was 2-2 the better race times of one female and one male time would break the draw. If still equal the fastest run time of any skier was used as a tiebreaker, and the final tiebreaker was the current World Nations Cup standings. The lower-placed team in the Nations Cup had to announce their four racers first, so the higher-placed team had the advantage of deciding who would race against whom. Every team match started with a women race followed by the men, and every nation had to compete with a woman and a man on the red and the blue course, respectively.
The first team event, at that time known as a combined team event, was held at the 2005 World championships in Bormio and was won by Germany. The first team event as part of the Alpine skiing World Cup was held in March 2006 in Ãre with Austria as the winner and, since then, a team event was regularly contested at the World Cup final. All these events did not use the parallel format as they were held as a kind of a combined event by just adding the times of Super G and slalom runs. The parallel format started in 2010 at the World Cup final and was won by the Czech Republic and in 2011 at the World Championships (winner France) with both competitions held in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. The last five Team Events contested as part of the World Cup were all won by Switzerland (Lenzerheide 2013/14, MÃ©ribel 2014/15 and St. Moritz 2015/16) and Sweden (Innsbruck 2013/14 and Aspen 2016/17), Austria became World Champion in 2015 and France won this event at the 2017 World Championship with Adeline Baud Mugnier, Nastasia Noens, Tessa Worley, Mathieu Faivre, Julien Lizeroux and Alexis Pinturault.
The qualification system for this event allowed the best 15 nations from the current overall World Nations Cup standings to compete with South Korea automatically qualified as the host nation. When Lichtenstein (11th), Croatia (15th), Serbia (17th), and Japan (18th) did not enter a team, the Czech Republic (16th) and Hungary (19th) were invited. There was no draw as the teams were seeded according to their Nations Cup position. Every team could enter three skiers of each gender and substitutions were allowed after every round. The event was not yet a priority for the skiers as Marcel Hirscher, Henrik Kristoffersen and Mikaela Shiffrin did not participate for their nations and Switzerland did not even enter six skiers.
The first round saw the elimination of the United States, seeded in fifth, when they lost to Great Britain by cumulated time after a 2-2 draw. France also had difficulty in advancing when they won by only 0.03 seconds against Canada. In the quarter-finals Austria eliminated Sweden with a 4-0 shutout, while Norway and Switzerland only won by aggregate time. After two clear wins by Austria and Switzerland in the semi-finals, the two arch-rivals met in the final.
Austria, who lost only one duel up to the final, was not able to challenge Switzerland in the final as both men did not finish their race. Switzerland won 3-1 to become the first ever Olympic mixed team event champion. Matt set the fastest overall time with 19.23 on the blue course in the quarter-finals against Sweden, while the second best time was raced on the red course by ZenhÃ¤usern with 19.33 against Germany in the same round. The best time for women was set by Holdener with 20.97 on the red course in the semi-finals against France, and Gallhuber raced the second fastest time with 21.04 on the blue course in the same duel as her compatriot Matt. The only substitution was made by Austria, when they replaced Marco Schwarz with Manuel Feller for the quarter-finals only, but all skiers entered by the teams received medals, including the non-starters.

At World Championships, the format was introduced in 2018, and in all four finals France faced Japan with Japan winning the title at every occasion. Based on the results of the individual events, this seemed to be the logical outcome also at the Olympics. So far, Japan won nine gold and one bronze and France one gold, three silver and three bronze, of which only two bronze came from the men events.
Both teams were spared from the elimination round, just like the teams of the Russian Olympic Committee and Brazil, two potential contenders for bronze. In the quarter-final, Japan, calling up six gold medallists, defeated Germany 4-2, but only after being behind 0-2. France also had a hard time beating Israel 4-3, when the extra fight had to be decided by Golden Score. While the Russian victory over Mongolia did not come unexpectedly, the Netherlands scored a 4-2 upset over Brazil, bronze medallist at the last two World Championships. Brazil was finally eliminated in the repÃªchage by Israel. Germany made the bronze medal contest by defeating Mongolia.
In the semi-finals, Japan and France scored one-sided 4-0 wins against the ROC and the Netherlands, respectively, without having to go into extra-time in any of the matches. The bronze medals were eventually taken by the dark horse Israel and Germany. In the final, four gold medallists represented Japan: Shohei Ono, Chizuru Arai, Akira Sone, and Aaron Wolf, and they were complemented by bronze medallist Tsukasa Yoshida and ninth placed Shoichiro Mukai. The French team consisted of Clarisse Agbegnenou (silver), Sarah-LÃ©onie Cysique (silver), Romane Dicko and Teddy Riner (both bronze), and non-medallists Axel Clerget, and Guillaume Chaine. Agbegnenou moved up one category and collected two Waza-aris (half points) to defeat the Japanese gold medallist Arai. Clerget threw Mukai by Sumi-otoshi (corner drop) in extra-time for a 2-0 lead. Sone, who already won gold on the day before, outscored Dicko by two Waza-ari to revive Japan hopes. French heavyweight legend Teddy Riner then scored a Waza-ari for the Golden Score in the clash of gold medallists defeating half-heavyweight Wolf to give France a comfortable lead. Sarah-LÃ©onie Cysique held on to an early lead by Waza-ari against Yoshida to earn France the fourth point and, hence, the gold medal.

For both it was their first ever and only World Cup win going into the Beijing Olympics.
The top 15 nations in the Nations Cup standings just before the Beijing Games qualified for this event with China, who had never won a World Cup point in history, being added as host. As Croatia in 12th and Great Britain in 14th withdrew and, of the other nations, only ROC decided to start, only 15 nations took part. This led to a first-round bye for Austria, who were Nations Cup leaders at the time. The first round saw a clear win for Switzerland over China and two close matches followed when Slovenia and Norway won only by total time elapsed. After the first round it was apparent that the blue course was faster than the red one, which meant that the skier on the red course was unable to win without a serious mistake of their rival on blue.
The most exciting of the quarter-finals was seen when Norway won on accumulated time over France by only 0.02 seconds. Austria won its semi-final by total time elapsed, while Germany won 3-1 after Paula Moltzan (blue course) and Emma Aicher (red course) both did not finish their run, but Aicher stayed on course a bit longer than Moltzan to win the point. Both the final and third place match were also decided on time only as both ended 2-2 with Austria winning gold, Germany silver, and Norway bronze.
The best run times had both been set on the blue course, by Andreja Slokar (24.07) and Trevor Philp (23.53), while the best times on the red course had been 24.51 by Tessa Worley and 23.85 by Å½an Kranjec. The times of Slokar, Philp, and Kranjec were all achieved in the very first match of the first round when they faced each other.
Johannes Strolz of Austria gold medal-winning team did not score any points for his country, as he always skied on the red course, but he did become the only Alpine skier at these Games to win two gold medals after earlier winning gold in the Alpine Combined. His teammate Katharina Liensberger, who won a slalom silver medal, became the most successful female Alpine skier at the Beijing Games. Finishing in fourth position with team USA, Mikaela Shiffrin again did not win a medal and she had to leave Beijing without a medal while Germany won its first Alpine skiing medal of the Games, in the very last event.

The Netherlands had last won a team jumping medal in 1936, while Austria had never before medalled in this event.

Only the top 12 teams advanced to the second round, from the 16 starters. West Germany struggled somewhat in round two, with 13.00 faults, as the United States had the best score with only 8.25 faults, but the West German lead was big enough to keep them in the lead, and bring them the gold medal.

The course was measured at 631 metres with 14 obstacles and 17 jumps, but only four of the 87 rounds were inside the time limit of 96 seconds, and it has been argued that the course was actually 693 metres long. Fifteen teams started the competition with only Ireland not finishing the two rounds. However, in Mexico City, if a rider did not finish a round, he and the team were not eliminated.

Best three scores in each round determined team total.  Separate competition.,na,"Germany, the champions in both Atlanta and Sydney, would enter this competition as marginal favourites but their domination of dressage was not mirrored in the jumping events. The German team had won the 2003 European Championships but France held the World Equestrian Games title and at least half the teams involved were expected to mount some sort of medal challenge.
The surprise of the first round was the poor performance of the French team, a serious injury to one of their horses in the middle of its round left them with only three team members to score. Placed ninth and distanced from the medal contenders, they opted to withdraw from the second phase. The first round ended with just four penalty points covering the first six teams with The Netherlands and USA sharing the lead on 8.00 faults. A single time penalty separated the leaders from the German team with Sweden, Switzerland and Belgium level on 12 faults in fourth.
The Swiss, Dutch and Belgians fell away in the second round leaving Germany, USA and Sweden to dispute the medal positions. Only four combinations achieved clear rounds in both phases of the event, Rolf-GÃ¶ran Bengtsson of Sweden, the USA Beezie Madden and importantly, the German pair of Marco Kutscher and Ludger Beerbaum. With Germany counting Otto Becker four-faulter and discarding the round of Christian Ahlmann this left the team on a grand total of 13 faults and seven clear of the Swedes and Americans tied in second. A jump-off for silver between three nominated members of each team finished with all six riders performing faultless rounds but the total aggregated times revealed the US to be seven seconds faster and placed them ahead of Sweden.
For Beerbaum this was to be his sixth Olympic gold â or so it seemed. A few weeks after the Games the FÃ©dÃ©ration Ãquestre Internationale announced that Beerbaum horse Goldfever 3 had tested positive for the prohibited substance betamethasone. Beerbaum argued that the corticosteroid may have been present in an ointment given to the horse to treat a skin irritation, and whilst the FEI agreed that the substance provided no competitive advantage they were left with no alternative but to disqualify the pairing. Beerbaum later appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) but they upheld the ruling of the FEI.
The United States were then upgraded to the gold medal position and Sweden to silver. Although Ludger Beerbaum record was expunged from the final results, Germany were not disqualified from the team event but had now to count the previous discarded scores from both rounds. This gave them a total of 21 penalties, which was still good enough for the bronze medal. The disqualification of Cian OâConnor meant that the Irish team, that had originally placed seventh, were removed from the official placings.

Germany, the defending gold medalist, was an easy winner of the competition, leading after the first round, and posting the best team score in both rounds to win the gold medal. The United States won the silver medal. Italy had the top two finishers in the individual jumping, with the DâInzeo brothers. Raimondo had the best individual performance in the team jumping, with only 8 total faults, but Piero struggled and Italy could only win a bronze medal. Germany would again win gold in this event at Tokyo in 1964, winning for the third consecutive Olympics.
German rider Fritz Thiedemann was aboard Meteor, as he had been in 1952 and 1956. Meteor was thus part of medals at three Olympics, as Thiedemann won the individual gold in 1952 and team golds in 1956-60, making Meteor the first horse to win medals at three Olympic Games. Meteor was a bay gelding who was foaled on 12 May 1943. He also carried riders to victories at the 1958 European Championships, the 1954 King George V Gold Cup, and at four Nations Cups.

Other favorites included France, which had won the 1982 World Championships, and the always strong West Germany and Great Britain teams.
The US led in the first round with only 4.00 faults, as Smith went clean, as did Fargis. Unfortunately, Smith horse, Calypso, was injured at the end of his ride and could not start the second round, which gave the US only three riders, so they could not afford a bad effort. They did fine. Fargis had another clean ride, for a perfect score, and Conrad Homfeld also went clean. Leslie Burr had 8.00 faults in round two, giving the US the best score in the second round to win the gold medal by the largest margin in a ârealâ Olympic competition since 1956 (discounting the 1980 junior varsity events).
Great Britain came in as a strong medal contender and proved their worth by winning the silver medal.

The 2019 World Shotgun Championships winners Laetisha Scanlan/James Willett also partnered up in Tokyo, with silver won by Yuliya Saveleva/Maksim Smykov (RUS) and bronze by Smith/Grice at those championships.
The qualification round was over 150 shots in total, with 75 by each shooter, and was topped by FÃ¡tima GÃ¡lvez/Alberto FernÃ¡ndez and Alessandra Perilli/Gian Marco Berti with 148 as both pairs missed only two targets. They were followed by Å tefeÄekovÃ¡/Varga and Madelynn Bernau/Brian Burrows, who both scored 146. As there was no second qualification stage like in the other two team events, the first two qualified for the gold medal match and the next two for the bronze medal match. A shoot-off for both was necessary to determine the places 1-2 and 3-4. This was important because in both medal matches the better placed team was allowed to start first.
The bronze medal match went into a shoot-off and Bernau/Burrows secured bronze with the third shot. During the match Å tefeÄekovÃ¡/Vargahad already led by three targets after 42 shots, but Bernau/Burrows managed to come back in the last eight shots to tie 42-42.

Racine and Davidson performances dipped at the beginning of the Olympic season and, despite having previously described as her best friend, the decision was made to replace Davidson with novice brakewoman Gea Johnson. Johnson herself was a controversial figure having served a suspension for steroid abuse while competing in track and field as a heptathlete and had only six months experience as a bobsledder. Whilst the form of the top American sled had dipped the German teams had advanced to the top of the world rankings. Former Olympic luge medalist Suzi Erdmann  had converted to bobsledding since the Nagano Games and topped the World Cup standings ahead of compatriot Sandra Prokoff.
Unlike the men event the inaugural women Olympic title was decided over two runs contested on a single day. The sensation of the first run was the performance of the USA II sled of pilot Jill Bakken  and brakewoman Vonetta Flowers. In a similar situation to the USA I sled Flowers had come into the team at late notice, replacing Bakken regular partner Shauna Rohbock, and her background in sprinting was put to good use as the team recorded impressive start times.  USA II actually lengthened their winning margin slightly with their second run impressive and were a third of a second clear of the first of two successive German crews. This was the first Olympic victory by the United States since the 1948 Games. The gamble made by the top American crew to include Gea Johnson failed disastrously as she suffered a hamstring injury and USA I could not finish higher than fifth.
The performance of the Dutch team in sixth was their nation best ever Winter Olympic finish outside the various disciplines of skating.
A feature of the first Olympic bobsleigh competition was the appearance of athletes who had been drafted in from other sports.

Weissensteiner had won the women luge in Albertville whilst Bellutti titles came in track cycling at Atlanta and Sydney. One former Olympic champion was barred from competing. Atlanta 100 m hurdles champion Ludmila Engquist  had been a part of the Swedish team on the World Cup circuit but registered a positive drug test shortly before the Games.
In hindsight perhaps the most important feature of this event was the sight of African-American Vonetta Flowers on the top step of the Olympic podium. Flowers was the first black champion in the 78 year history of the Winter Games.

Elliot and Jensen tied for first place but Jensen was awarded first place by the judges, based on his having lifted in a better style, as apparently Elliot moved one foot while lifting his weight.  From the article by Ian Buchanan in Citius, Altius, Fortius (Vol. 3, No. 1, p. 20), we have:
âThe two-handed lift came first on the program and, after a long drawn out contest, Viggo Jensen of Denmark and Elliot had both lifted 110 kg., but Prince George awarded the Dane first place for having done so in better style.  Jensen lift was accomplished with a superb clean lift whereas Elliot had certainly encountered difficulty but to award the Olympic title on the basis of âstyleâ was a decision to which Lawrence Levy, understandably, took exception.
âLevy main objection was that, as both contestants had lifted the same weight, they should now each be given the chance to lift a heavier weight in accordance with all known weightlifting protocol.  Prince George then agreed with Levy view but the decision was rendered academic by the rider to the judgment that there were, in fact, no heavier weights available.  Levy stood his ground and eventually plates were screwed onto the barbell and lifting was resumed.  After Jensen had raised the bar, Levy again objected, this time on the grounds that Jensen method was not in accordance with the rules.
âAgain Prince George sided against Levy and once more lifting was resumed, by which time most of the spectators had left but they didnât miss a great deal as, eventually, the original result based on âstyleâ was allowed to stand.  By contrast, the one-handed event was a short, sharp event.  Elliot declined Prince George courteous offer of a rest break but he asked that he might this time lift after Jensen, as in the two-handed event the Dane had the advantage of lifting after Elliot.  The request was granted although the order of lifting was not to have a material effect on the result.  Elliot raised 71.0 kg. without difficulty whereas Jensen, who had injured his shoulder trying to raise 112.5 kg. in the two-handed event, could only manage 57.2 kg. and Britain first Olympic champion was crowned.
âOne feature that stands out from the judging of the competition is the inherent courtesy exercised by Prince George throughout the proceedings.  Despite the constant protests of Lawrence Levy, the Prince sought him out that evening at an illumination display at the Royal Palace, and smilingly enquired âAre you calmer now, Mr. Levy?ââ
Levy was apparently unaware of the rules stating that the tie-breaker was the style of the lift.

With no strong favorite, everybody in the field had a chance to get on the podium.
Two medalists from the 2012 Olympic Games were competing â the gold medalist from Azerbaijan ToÄrul ÆsgÉrov, and the bronze medalist Yogeshwar Dutt of India, who was competing in his fourth Olympic Games. Other contenders were world-ranked number one Frank Chamizo of Italy, the 2015 World champion who had lost Asgarov in the European final; the 2014 World champion and 2015 bronze medalist Soslan Ramonov from Russia, and two-time World bronze medalist (2013, 2014) Ganzorigiin Mandakhnaran of Mongolia.
In the end, it was Ramonov beating the defending Olympic champion Asgarov (60 kg) in just two minutes five seconds in the gold medal bout. He scored 11 unanswered points, winning 11-0 on technical points in a bout that was much harder than the score line indicated.
The much-decorated Asgarov (2010 World silver medalist, 2012 European champion, 2015 European Games gold medalist), who captured his second Olympic medal in as many Games, felt great fatigue after a tough semi-final against Italian Chamizo, who went on to earn the bronze medal beating American Frank Molinaro.
The other bronze medal match had the Mongolian Mandakhnaran leading his opponent Ikhtiyor Navruzov of Uzbekistan, 7-6 and he started celebrating with only seconds left. The judges, however, awarded a penalty point because Mandakhnaran was not engaging with an opponent during the match and with the score tied at 7-7, Navruzov was awarded the victory by virtue of earning the last point. What proceeded was an epic meltdown from Mandakhnaran coaches, who stripped down to their underwear, which only prompted the referees to award Navruzov another penalty point for the Mongolian outburst following the match. Mandakhnaran refused to accept the decision and walked away from the referee who was about hold the hand up of Navruzov to make the match official.

The defending Olympic champion was Ramazan Åahin of Turkey, who had been World Champion in 2007 and European Champion in 2008, but had little to show on the international stage since his victory in Beijing. This left the final open for challengers such as Sushil Kumar, a bronze medalist from the 2008 Games and India first World Champion wrestler, having won the title in 2010 along with the Commonwealth Games and the Asian Championships. There was also a threat from Russia Alan Gogayev, reigning European Champion and runner-up at the 2010 World Championships.
Taghavi and Gogayev were both drawn in the same bracket, but shockingly lost their first rounds to LivÃ¡n LÃ³pez of Cuba and Zalimkhan Yusupov of Tajikistan respectively. Both were unheralded wrestlers who were not expected to contend for a medal (although LÃ³pez had bronze from the 2011 World Championships) paving the way for Tatsuhiro Yonemitsu of Japan, 2010 Asian Games Champion and runner up at the most recent World Championships and the 2009 Asian Championships, to battle for gold. LÃ³pez and Yusupov eventual elimination meant that neither Taghavi nor Gogayev would compete for a medal. In the top half, Kumar defeated Åahin in his opening round and went on to win the bracket and challenge Yonemitsu. The first period of the final was somewhat tame, with the Japanese wrestler scoring the lone point to win. In the second round, Yonemitsu was able to lift the Indian and toss him on his back, scoring three points. Although Kumar was able to score one point, the period, and the gold medal, went to Japan. Neither wrestler went home without a place in the history books, however, as Yonemitsu was Japan first male wrestling gold medalist since in 1988 and Kumar was the first Indian wrestler to reach an Olympic final.
In the first bronze medal match, Åahin met Akzhurek Tanatarov of Kazakhstan, who had never reached the podium at a major international event. Åahin was the favorite in the match and lived up to expectations by outscoring Tanatarov 4-1 in the opening period. Tanatarov came back in the second round, however, when, with the score tied 1-1 in the final 10 seconds, scored a winning point with a takedown that gave  him a 3-1 victory following an unsuccessful challenge from the Turkish coaches. The first half of the final period was intense, with the Kazakh outscoring the Turk 4-2, sufficient in the end to win him the round and the bronze medal. For the final podium spot, LÃ³pez battled CÉbrayÄ±l HÉsÉnov of Azerbaijan, European Champion in 2010 and 2011, runner-up in 2009, and bronze medalist at the last two World Championships. HÉsÉnov won the first round with three points in the final 15 seconds, but LÃ³pez came back strong in the final two periods scoring two unanswered points for his first victory and pinning his opponent in the final 15 seconds of the match for the bronze.

Abdvali and GuÃ©not met during the quarterfinals, where the Frenchman defeated the Iranian in a controversial match that saw Abdvali lose the first round to penalty fouls after a successful par terre defense and the second after a successful par terre offense that was discounted after it was deemed too low on the body. While the replay showed that Abdvali was indeed too low in the second round, many Iranians felt that the referee and the match judge were unfairly penalizing Abdvali while ignoring fouls committed by GuÃ©not.
Abdvali was denied any chance at a medal when GuÃ©not lost to Kim Hyeon-Wu, a bronze medalist from the 2011 World Championships, in the semi-finals. In the final Kim faced LÅrincz, where Kim was nearly flipped in the first round par terre, although he maintained his defense to take the period.

For the final podium spot GuÃ©not faced Pedro Mulens of Cuba, a two-time World Championship bronze medalist (2009 and 2011). The Frenchman immediately asserted his dominance with a four-point takedown to win the first round and then maintained a more defensive attitude in the second to bring the period to par terre.
